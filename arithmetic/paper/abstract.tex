\begin{abstract}
  The theory of arithmetic is integral to many uses of SMT solvers.
  Z3 has implemented native solvers for arithmetic reasoning since its first release.
  We present a full re-implementation of Z3's original
  arithmetic solver. It is based on substantial experiences from user feedback, engineering and experimentation.
  While providing a comprehensive overview of the main components
  we emphasize selected new insights we arrived at while developing and testing the solver.
