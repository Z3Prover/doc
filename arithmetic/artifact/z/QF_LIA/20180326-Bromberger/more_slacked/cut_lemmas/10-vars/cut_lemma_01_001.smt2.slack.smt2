Application: This is a problem with unbounded directions and, therefore, a good test for the termination/completeness of branch-and-bound solvers.
Publications: M. Bromberger. A Reduction from Unbounded Linear Mixed Arithmetic Problems into Bounded Problems. (Work in progress.)

The benchmarks in this class are based on the problems from SMT-LIB/QF_LIA/CAV_2009 and SMT-LIB/QF_LIA/cut_lemmas.
I just replaced all variables x with x_+ - x_-, where x_+ and x_- are two new variables such that x_+, x_- >= 0.
This transformation is equisatisfiable.
The new variables and an unsatisfiable status guarantee that there are bounded and unbounded directions.
Target solver: CVC4 Mathsat SPASS-IQ YICES Z3
