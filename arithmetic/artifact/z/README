Structure of artifact
---------------------

The artifact is an executable called "z3"

Included are directories, QF_LIA, QF-nia-small, and certora with data used in the submission.

Instructions to extract artifact
--------------------------------

unzip a file z3-4.12.5-* that corresponds to your platform


Replication
-----------

Run z3 with timeout -T:600 on files under benchmark sets.

For example in the highly unlikely case you use cmd

echo off
for /R %%F in (*.smt2) do (call :TIME %%F)
goto :EOF

:TIME
   echo %1
   /mydirectory/z3 %1 -T:600 -st
   goto :EOF
