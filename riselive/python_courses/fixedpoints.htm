<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
This tutorial covers some of the fixedpoint utilities available with Z3.
The main features are a basic Datalog engine, an engine with relational
algebra and an engine based on a generalization of the Property
Directed Reachability algorithm.
</p>


<h2>Basic Datalog </h2>

<p>The default fixed-point engine is a bottom-up Datalog engine. 
It works with finite relations and uses finite table representations
as hash tables as the default way to represent finite relations.
</p>

<h3>Relations, rules and queries</h3>

The first example illustrates how to declare relations, rules and
how to pose queries.

<pre pref="fixedpoint.1" />

The example illustrates some of the basic constructs.
<pre>
  fp = Fixedpoint()
</pre>
creates a context for fixed-point computation.
<pre>
 fp.register_relation(a.decl(), b.decl(), c.decl())
</pre>
Register the relations <tt>a, b, c</tt> as recursively defined.
<pre>
 fp.rule(a,b)
</pre>
Create the rule that <tt>a</tt> follows from <tt>b</tt>. 
In general you can create a rule with multiple premises and a name using 
the format
<pre>
 fp.rule(<em>head</em>,[<em>body1,...,bodyN</em>],<em>name</em>)
</pre>
The <em>name</em> is optional. It is used for tracking the rule in derivation proofs.

Continuing with the example, <tt>a</tt> is false unless <tt>b</tt> is established.
<pre>
 fp.query(a)
</pre>
Asks if <tt>a</tt> can be derived. The rules so far say that <tt>a</tt> 
follows if <tt>b</tt> is established and that <tt>b</tt> follows if <tt>c</tt> 
is established. But nothing establishes <tt>c</tt> and <tt>b</tt> is also not
established, so <tt>a</tt> cannot be derived.
<pre>
 fp.fact(c)
</pre>
Add a fact (shorthand for <tt>fp.rule(c,True)</tt>).
Now it is the case that <tt>a</tt> can be derived.

<h3>Explanations</h3>
<p>
It is also possible to get an explanation for a derived query.
For the finite Datalog engine, an explanation is a trace that
provides information of how a fact was derived. The explanation
is an expression whose function symbols are Horn rules and facts used
in the derivation.
</p>

<h3>Relations with arguments</h3>
<p>
Relations can take arguments. We illustrate relations with arguments
using edges and paths in a graph.
</p>
<pre pref="fixedpoint.3" />

The example uses the declaration
<pre>
 fp.declare_var(a,b,c)
</pre>
to instrument the fixed-point engine that <tt>a, b, c</tt> 
should be treated as variables
when they appear in rules. Think of the convention as they way bound variables are
passed to quantifiers in Z3Py.

<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p>
A more entertaining example of using the basic fixed point engine
is to solve the Rush Hour puzzle. The puzzle is about moving
a red car out of a gridlock. We have encoded a configuration 
and compiled a set of rules that encode the legal moves of the cars
given the configuration. Other configurations can be tested by
changing the parameters passed to the constructor for <t>Car</t>.
We have encoded the configuration from 
<a href="http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RHfromMarkRiedel/Jam.html?40" target=_top> 
an online puzzle you can solve manually, or cheat on by asking Z3</a>.
</p>
<pre pref="fixedpoint.4" />


<h2>Abstract Domains</h2>
The underlying engine uses table operations 
that are based on relational algebra. Representations are
opaque to the underlying engine. 
Relational algebra operations are well defined for arbitrary relations.
They don't depend on whether the relations denote a finite or an 
infinite set of values.
Z3 contains two built-in tables for infinite domains.
The first is for intervals of integers and reals.
The second is for bound constraints between two integers or reals. 
A bound constraint is of the form <tt>x < y</tt> or <tt> x <= y</tt>.
When used in conjunction, they form
an abstract domain that is called the 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642309000719">
<em>Pentagon</em></a> abstract
domain. Z3 implements <em>reduced products</em>
of abstract domains that enables sharing constraints between
the interval and bounds domains.

<p>
Below we give a simple example that illustrates a loop at location <tt>l0</tt>.
The loop is incremented as long as the loop counter does not exceed an upper
bound. Using the combination of bound and interval domains
we can collect derived invariants from the loop and we can also establish
that the state after the loop does not exceed the bound.
</p>


<pre pref="fixedpoint.5" />

The example uses the option
<pre>
   set_option(dl_compile_with_widening=True)
</pre>
to instrument Z3 to apply abstract interpretation <em>widening</em> on loop boundaries. 


<h2>Engine for Property Directed Reachability</h2>

A different underlying engine for fixed-points is based on
an algorithm for <it>Property Directed Reachability (PDR)</it>.
The PDR engine is enabled using the instruction
<pre>
  set_option(dl_engine=1)
</pre>
The version in Z3 applies to Horn clauses with arithmetic and
Boolean domains. When using arithmetic you should enable
the main abstraction engine used in Z3 for arithmetic in PDR.
<pre>
 set_option(dl_pdr_use_farkas=True)
</pre>
The engine also works with domains using algebraic
data-types and bit-vectors, although it is currently not
overly tuned for either.
The PDR engine is targeted at applications from symbolic model 
checking of software. The systems may be infinite state. 
The following examples also serve a purpose of showing 
how software model checking problems (of safety properties)
can be embedded into Horn clauses and solved using PDR.

<h3>Procedure Calls</h3>
<p>
McCarthy's 91 function illustrates a procedure that calls itself recursively
twice. The Horn clauses below encode the recursive function:

<pre>
  mc(x) = if x > 100 then x - 10 else mc(mc(x+11))
</pre>

The general scheme for encoding recursive procedures is by creating a predicate
for each procedure and adding an additional output variable to the predicate.
Nested calls to procedures within a body can be encoded as a conjunction
of relations.
</p>

<pre pref="fixedpoint.8" />

The first two queries are unsatisfiable. The PDR engine produces the same proof of unsatisfiability.
The proof is an inductive invariant for each recursive predicate. The PDR engine introduces a
special query predicate for the query.

<h3>Bakery</h3>

<p>
We can also prove invariants of reactive systems. It is convenient to encode reactive systems
as guarded transition systems. It is perhaps for some not as convenient to directly encode 
guarded transitions as recursive Horn clauses. But it is fairly easy to write a translator
from guarded transition systems to recursive Horn clauses. We illustrate a translator
and Lamport's two process Bakery algorithm in the next example.
</p>

<pre pref="fixedpoint.9" />
The rather verbose (and in no way minimal) inductive invariants are produced as answers.

<h3>Functional Programs</h3>
We can also verify some properties of functional programs using Z3's 
generalized PDR. Let us here consider an example from 
<a href="http://www.kb.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~uhiro/">
<em>Predicate Abstraction and CEGAR for Higher-Order Model 
Checking, Kobayashi et.al. PLDI 2011</em></a>.
We encode functional programs by taking a suitable operational
semantics and encoding an evaluator that is specialized to
the program being verified (we don't encode a general purpose
evaluator, you should partial evaluate it to help verification).
We use algebraic data-types to encode the current closure that is
being evaluated.
