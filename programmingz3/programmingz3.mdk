~ Abstract
This tutorial provides a programmer's introduction to the Satisfiability Modulo Theories Solver Z3.
It describes how to use Z3 through scripts, provided in the Python scripting language, and it describes
several of the algorithms underlying the decision procedures within Z3. It aims to broadly cover
almost all available features of Z3 and the essence of the underlying algorithms.

# Introduction { #sec-intro }

Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving refers to theorem proving 
on logical formulas that use symbols whose meaning are given by background theories, 
such as arithmetic. SMT solving enjoys a synergetic 
relationship with software analysis, verification and symbolic execution tools. 
This is in many respects thanks to the emphasis on supporting domains commonly 
found in programs and specifications.
There are several scenarios where part of a query posed by these tools can 
be cast in terms of formulas in a supported logic. It is then useful for the
tool writer to have an idea of what are available supported logics, and 
have an idea of how formulas are solved. But interacting with SMT
solvers is not always limited to posing a query as a single formula. 
It may require a sequence of interactions to obtain a usable answer
and the need emerges for the tool writer for having an idea of what methods and knobs are available. 
In summary, this tutorial aims to answer the following types of questions
through examples and a touch of theory:

* What are the available features in Z3, and what are they designed to be used for?

* What are the underlying algorithms used in Z3?

* How can I program applications on top of Z3?


Figure [#fig-system] shows an overall systems diagram of Z3, as of version 4.8.
The top left summarizes the interfaces to Z3. 
One can interact with Z3 over SMT-LIB2 scripts supplied as a text file or pipe to Z3, 
or using API calls from a high-level programming language that are proxies for 
calls over a C-based API. We focus on using the Python front-end as a means of
interfacing with Z3, and start out describing the abstract syntax of terms and
formulas accepted by Z3 in Section [#sec-logical-interface].
Formulas draw from symbols whose meaning are defined by a set of _Theories_, 
Section [#sec-theories]. _Solvers_, Sections [#sec-solver-interfacing], [#sec-using-solvers] and [#sec-solver-implementations], 
provide services for deciding satisfiability of formula. _Tactics_, Section [#sec-tactics], provide means for
pre-processing simplification and creating sub-goals. Z3 also provides some services
that are not purely satisfiability queries. _Optimization_, Section [#sec-optimization],
services allow users to solve satisfiability modulo objective functions to maximize or
minimize values. There are also specialized procedures for enumerating _consequences_ (backbone literals)
described in Section [#sec-consequences].

## Sources
The material in this tutorial is assembled from several sources.
Some of the running examples originate from slides that have 
circulated in the SAT and SMT community. The first SAT example is
shamelessly lifted from Armin Biere's SAT tutorials and other examples 
appear in slides by Natarajan Shankar. 


# Logical Interfaces to Z3 { #sec-logical-interface }
Z3 takes as input simple-sorted formulas that may contain 
symbols with pre-defined meanings defined by a _theory_.
This section provides an introduction to logical formulas that can be used as input to Z3. 

As a basis, propositional formulas are built from atomic variables and logical connectives.
An example propositional logical formula
accepted by Z3 is:
```python
  from z3 import *
  Tie, Shirt = Bools('Tie Shirt')
  s = Solver()
  s.add(Or(Tie, Shirt), 
        Or(Not(Tie), Shirt), 
        Or(Not(Tie), Not(Shirt)))
  print(s.check())
  print(s.model())
```
The example introduces two Boolean variables `Tie`{language:python} and `Shirt`{language:python}. 
It then creates a `Solver`{language:python} object and adds three assertions.
~ MathPre
  (Tie \vee Shirt) \wedge (\neg Tie \vee Shirt) \wedge (\neg Tie \vee \neg Shirt)
~
The call to `s.check()`{language:python} produces a verdict `sat`{language:python}; 
there is a satisfying assignment for the formulas. 
A satisfying model, where `Tie`{language:python} is false and `Shirt`{language:python} is true, 
can be extracted using `s.model()`{language:python}.
For convenience the Python front-end to Z3 contains some shorthand functions. 
The function `solve`{language:python} 
sets up a solver, adds assertions, checks satisfiability, and prints a model if one is available.

Propositional logic is an important, but smaller subset of formulas handled by Z3. 
It can reason about formulas that combine symbols from several theories, such as the theories for 
arrays and arithmetic:
```python
  Z = IntSort()
  f = Function('f', Z, Z)
  x, y, z = Ints('x y z')
  A = Array('A', Z, Z)
  fml = Implies(x + 2 == y, f(Store(A, x, 3)[y - 2]) == f(y - x + 1))
  solve(Not(fml))
```  

The formula `fml` is valid. It is true for all values of integers _x_, _y_, _z_, array _A_, 
and no matter what the graph of the function _f_ is. 
Note that we are using `array[index]` as shorthand for `Select(array, index)`.
We can manually verify the validity of the formula using the following argument:
The integer constants `x` and `y` are created using the function `Ints` that
creates a list of integer constants.
Under the assumption that `x + 2 = y`, the right side of the implication simplifies to
```python
f(Store(A, x, 3)[x]) == f(3)
```
as we have replaced occurrences of `y` by `x - 2`. There are no restrictions on what `f` is, so
the equality with `f` on both sides will only follow if the arguments to `f` are the same. Thus, 
we are left to establish
```python
Store(A, x, 3)[x] == 3
```
The left side is a term in the theory of arrays, which captures applicative maps. `Store` updates the array `A`
at position `x` with the value 3. Then `...[x]` retrieves the contents of the array at index `x`, which in this
case is 3.
Dually, the _negation_ of `fml` is unsatisfiable and the call to Z3 produces `unsat`.

Formulas accepted by Z3 generally follow the formats described in the SMT-LIB2 standard [@SMTLIB2].
This standard (currently at version 2.6) defines a textual language for first-order multi-sorted
logic and a set of _logics_ that are defined by a selection of background theories. 
For example, the logic of _quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic_, known in SMT-LIB2 
as `QF_LIA`{language:smt}, is a fragment of first-order logic, where formulas are _quantifier free_, 
variables range over integers, interpreted constants are integers, the allowed functions are _+_, _-_, 
integer multiplication, division, remainder, modulus with a constant, and the allowed relations
are, besides equality that is part of every theory, also  _<, <=, >=, >_.
As an example, we provide an SMT-LIB and a Python variant of the same arbitrary formula:
```smt
 (set-logic QF_LIA)
 (declare-const x Int)
 (declare-const y Int)
 (assert (> (+ (mod x 4) (* 3 (div y 2))) (- x y)))
 (check-sat)
```
Python version:
```python
 solve((x % 4) + 3 * (y / 2) > x - y)
```
It is also possible to extract an SMT-LIB2 representation of a solver state.
```python
from z3 import *
x, y = Ints('x y')
s = Solver()
s.add((x % 4) + 3 * (y / 2) > x - y)
print(s.sexpr())
```
produces the output
```smt
(declare-fun y () Int)
(declare-fun x () Int)
(assert (> (+ (mod x 4) (* 3 (div y 2))) (- x y)))
```

## Sorts
Generally, SMT-LIB2 formulas use a finite set of simple sorts. 
It includes the built-in sort `Bool`{language:smt}, and supported theories
define their own sorts, noteworthy `Int`{language:smt}, `Real`{language:smt}, 
bit-vectors `(_ BitVec n)`{language:smt}
for every positive bit-width _n_, arrays \
`(Array Index Elem)`{language:smt} for every sort _Index_ and _Elem_, 
`String`{language:smt} and sequences `(Seq S)`{language:smt} for every sort _S_.
It is also possible to declare new sorts. Their domains may never be empty.
Thus, the formula
``` python
 S = DeclareSort('S')
 s = Const('s', S)
 solve(ForAll(s, s != s))
```
is unsatisfiable.

## Signatures
Formulas may include a mixture of interpreted and free functions and constants.
For example, the integer constants 0 and 28 are interpreted, while constants _x_, 
_y_ used in the previous example are free. Constants are treated as nullary functions.
Functions that take arguments can be declared, such as 
`f = Function('f', Z, Z)` creates the function declaration that takes one integer
argument and its range is an integer. Functions with Boolean range can be used to create
formulas.

## Terms and Formulas
Formulas that are used in assertions or added to solvers 
are terms of Boolean sort. Otherwise, terms of Boolean and non-Boolean sort
may be mixed in any combination where sorts match up.
For example
```python
B = BoolSort()
f = Function('f', B, Z)
g = Function('g', Z, B)
a = Bool('a')
solve(g(1+f(a)))
```
could produce a solution of the form
```python
[a = False, f = [else -> 0], g = [else -> True]]
```
The model assigns `a` to False, the graph of `f` maps
all arguments to `0`, and the graph of `g` maps all values to `True`.
Standard built-in logical connectives are `And, Or, Not, Implies, Xor`. 
Bi-implication is a special case of equality, so from Python, when saying 
`a == b` for Boolean _a_ and _b_ it is treated as a logical formula for the 
bi-implication of _a_ and _b_.

A set of utilities are available to traverse expressions once they are created.
Every function application has a function _declaration_ and a set of _arguments_
accessed as children.

```python
x = Int('x')
y = Int('y')
n = x + y >= 3
print("num args: ", n.num_args())
print("children: ", n.children())
print("1st child:", n.arg(0))
print("2nd child:", n.arg(1))
print("operator: ", n.decl())
print("op name:  ", n.decl().name())
```

## Quantifiers and Lambda binding
Universal and existential quantifiers bind variables to the scope of the quantified
formula. For example
```python
solve([y == x + 1, ForAll([y], Implies(y <= 0, x < y))])
```
has no solution because no matter what value we assigned to `x`, there is a value for `y` that is non-positive and smaller than that value.  The bound occurrence of `y` is unrelated to the free occurrence where `y` is restricted to be `x + 1`.
The equality constraint `y == x + 1` should also not be mistaken for an assignment to `y`. It is _not_ the case that
bound occurrences of `y` are a synonym for `x + 1`.
Notice that the slightly different formula 
```python
solve([y == x + 1, ForAll([y], Implies(y <= 0, x > y))])
```
has a solution where _x_ is 1 and the free occurrence of _y_ is 2.

Z3 supports also $\lambda$-binding with rudimentary reasoning support based on a model-constructing instantiation engine.
$\lambda$s may be convenient when expressing properties of arrays and Z3 uses array sorts for representing the
sorts of lambda expressions. 
Thus, the result of `memset` is an array from integers to integers, that produces the value `y` in 
the range from `lo` to `hi` and otherwise behaves as `m` outside the range.
Z3 reasons about quantifier free formulas that contains `memset` by instantiating the body of
the $\lambda$.
```python
m, m1 = Array('m', Z, Z), Array('m1', Z, Z)
def memset(lo, hi, y, m):
    return Lambda([x], If(And(lo <= x, x <= hi), y, Select(m, x)))
solve([m1 == memset(1, 700, z, m), Select(m1, 6) != z])
```
Lambda binding is convenient for creating closures. Recall that meaining
of ```Lambda([x,y], e)```, where `e` is an expression with free
occurrences of `x` and `y` is as a function that takes two arguments
and substitutes their values for `x` and `y` in `e`.
Z3 uses Lambda lifting, in conjunction with Reynold's defunctionalization, 
to reduce reasoning about closures to universally quantified definitions.
Z3 treats arrays as general function spaces. All first-order definable functions may be arrays.
Some second-order theorems can be established by synthesizing $\lambda$ terms by instantiation.
Thus,

```python
Q = Array('Q', Z, B)
prove(Implies(ForAll(Q, Implies(Select(Q, x), Select(Q, y))), 
              x == y))
```
is provable. Z3 synthesizes an instantiation corresponding to `Lambda(z, z == x)` for _Q_.

# Theories { #sec-theories }
We will here summarize the main theories supported in Z3. In a few cases we will 
give a brief taste of decision procedures used for these theories. 
Readers who wish to gain a more in-depth understanding of how these 
decision procedures are implemented may follow some of the
citations.

## EUF: Equality and Uninterpreted Functions

The logic of _equality and uninterpreted function_, EUF, is a basic ingredient for first-order predicate logic.
Before there are theories, there are constants, functions and predicate symbols, and the built-in relation of equality.
In the following example, _f_ is a unary function, _x_ a constant. The first invocation of `solve` is feasible with
a model where _x_ is interpreted as an element in _S_ and _f_ is an identify function. The second invocation of _solve_
is infeasible; there are no models where _f_ maps _x_ to anything but itself given the two previous equalities.
```python
  S = DeclareSort('S')
  f = Function('f', S, S)
  x = Const('x', S)
  solve(f(f(x)) == x, f(f(f(x))) == x)
  solve(f(f(x)) == x, f(f(f(x))) == x, f(x) != x)
```

Decision procedures for quantifier-free EUF formulas are usually based 
on _union-find_ [@Tarjan75] to maintain equivalence classes of terms that are equated.
Pictorially, a sequence of equality assertions $a = b, b = c, b = s$ produce
one equivalence class that captures the transitivity of equality. 
~ Snippet
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix[nodes={draw}, row sep=0.3cm,column sep=0.5cm] {
  \node [rectangle, draw=none] (eq) {$a = b, b = c, d = e, b = s, d = t: $}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (abcs) {$a, b, c, s$}; &
  \node [circle, draw] (det) {$d, e, t$}; \\
 };
\end{tikzpicture}
~
It is possible to check for satisfiability of disequalities by checking whether
the equivalence classes associated with two disequal terms are the same or not.
Thus, adding $a \neq d$ does not produce a contradiction, and it can be checked
by comparing $a$'s class representative with $d$'s representative.
~ Snippet
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix[nodes={draw}, row sep=0.3cm,column sep=0.5cm] {
  \node [rectangle, draw=none] (eq) {$a = b, b = c, d = e, b = s, d = t, a \neq d: $}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (abcs) {$a, b, c, s$}; &
  \node [circle, draw] (det) {$d, e, t$}; \\
 };
\end{tikzpicture}
~
On the other hand, when asserting $c \neq s$, we can deduce a conflict as
the two terms asserted to be disequal belong to the same class. Class membership
with union-find data-structures is amortized nearly constant time.
~ Snippet
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix[nodes={draw}, row sep=0.3cm,column sep=0.5cm] {
  \node [rectangle, draw=none] (eq) {$a = b, b = c, d = e, b = s, d = t, c \neq s: $}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (abcs) {$a, b, c, s$}; &
  \node [circle, draw] (det) {$d, e, t$}; \\
 };
\end{tikzpicture}
~

Union-find alone is insufficient when function symbols are used, as with the following example,

~ MathPre
  a = b, b = c, d = e, b = s, d = t, f(a, g(d)) \neq  f(b, g(e))
~ 

In this case decision procedures require reasoning with the congruence rule

~ Math
    x_1 = y_1 \cdots x_n = y_n \ \Rightarrow \ f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = f(y_1, \ldots, y_n)
~

As a preparation for solving our example, let us introduce constants
that can be used as shorthands for sub-terms. Thus, introduce
constants $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ as representatives for the
four compound sub-terms.


$a = b, b = c, d = e, b = s, d = t, v_3 \neq {v_4}$
$v_1 := g(e), v_2 := g(d), v_3 := f(a, v_2), {v_4 := f(b, v_1)}$


Having only the equality information available we obtain the equivalence classes:
~ Snippet
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix[nodes={draw}, row sep=0.3cm,column sep=0.5cm] {
  \node [circle, draw] (abcs) {$a, b, c, s$}; &
  \node [circle, draw] (det) {$d, e, t$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v1) {$v_1$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v2) {$v_2$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v3) {$v_3$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v4) {$v_4$}; \\
 };
\end{tikzpicture}
~

Working bottom-up, the congruence rule dictates that the classes for $v_1$ and $v_2$
should be merged. Thus, 

~ Math 
    e = d \ \Rightarrow \ g(e) = g(d)
~

implies the following coarser set of equivalences.

~ Snippet
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix[nodes={draw}, row sep=0.3cm,column sep=0.5cm] {
  \node [circle, draw] (abcs) {$a, b, c, s$}; &
  \node [circle, draw] (det) {$d, e, t$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v12) {$v_1, v_2$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v3) {$v_3$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v4) {$v_4$}; \\
 };
\end{tikzpicture}
~

At this point, the congruence rule can be applied a second time,

~ Math 
   a = b, v_2 = v_1 \Rightarrow \ f(a, v_2) = f(b, v_1)
~

producing the equivalence classes

~ Snippet
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix[nodes={draw}, row sep=0.3cm,column sep=0.5cm] {
  \node [circle, draw] (abcs) {$a, b, c, s$}; &
  \node [circle, draw] (det) {$d, e, t$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v12) {$v_1, v_2$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v34) {$v_3, v_4$}; \\ 
 };
\end{tikzpicture}
~
The classes for $v_3$ and $v_4$ are now merged. As our original formula required these to
be distinct, congruence closure reasoning determines that the formula is unsatisfiable.

### Congruence Closure {#sec-cc}

We have implicitly used the notion of _congruence closure_ [@DowneyST80] 
to check satisfiability of equalities.
Let us more formally define this notion.
Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a set of terms and $\mathcal{E}$ set of equalities over $\mathcal{T}$.
A _congruence closure_ over $\mathcal{T}$ modulo $\mathcal{E}$ is the finest partition $cc$ of 
$\mathcal{T}$, such that:

* if $(s = t) \in \mathcal{E}$, then $s, t$ are in the same partition in $cc$.

* for $s := f(s_1, \ldots, s_k), t := f(t_1, \ldots, t_k) \in \mathcal{T}$, 
  * if $s_i, t_i$ are in same partition of $cc$ for each $i = 1, \ldots k$, 
  * then $s, t$ are in the same partition under $cc$.

~ Definition
 $cc: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow 2^{\mathcal{T}}$, maps term to its equivalence class.
~

### EUF Models

A satisfiable version of the running example is:

$a = b, b = c, d = e, b = s, d = t, f(a, g(d)) \neq  {f(g(e), b)}$

It induces the following definitions and equalities:
$a = b, b = c, d = e, b = s, d = t, v_3 \neq v_4$ \
$v_1 := g(e), v_2 := g(d), v_3 := f(a, v_2), v_4 := f(v_1, b)$
and we can associate a distinct value with each equivalence class.

~ Snippet {text-align:left}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix[nodes={draw}, row sep=0.3cm,column sep=0.5cm] {
  \node [circle, draw] (abcs) {$\diamond_0: a, b, c, s$}; &
  \node [circle, draw] (det) {$\diamond_1: d, e, t$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v12) {$\diamond_2: v_1, v_2$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v3) {$\diamond_3: v_3$}; & 
  \node [circle, draw] (v4) {$\diamond_4: v_4$}; \\
 };
\end{tikzpicture}
~

When presenting the formula to Z3 as
```python
S = DeclareSort('S')
a, b, c, d, e, s, t = Consts('a b c d e s t', S)
f = Function('f', S, S, S)
g = Function('g', S, S)
solve([a == b, b == c, d == e, b == s, 
       d == t, f(a, g(d)) != f(g(e), b)])
```
it produces a model, that may look as follows:
```python
[s = S!val!0, b = S!val!0, a = S!val!0,
 c = S!val!0, d = S!val!1, e = S!val!1, t = S!val!1,
 f = [(S!val!2, S!val!0) -> S!val!4, else -> S!val!3],
 g = [else -> S!val!2]]
```
In the model the value `S!val!0` is a fresh constant that is distinct from `S!val!1`.
The graph for `f` maps the arguments `(S!val!2, S!val!0)` to `S!val!4`. All
other arguments are mapped by the `else` clause to `S!val!3`. The `else` clause
is used as the default interpretation of arguments that are not listed in the interpretation.
The interpretation of _S_ is a finite set 
```python
    {S!val!0, S!val!1, S!val!2, S!val!3, S!val!4}.
```


## Arithmetic

Arithmetical constraints are nearly ubiquitous in software models. 
Even though mainstream software operates with finite precision arithmetic,
that is modeled precisely using bit-vectors, 
arithmetic over unbounded integers can often be used in a sound way to model software. 
Furthermore, arithmetic over the reals has been used for diverse areas such as models 
of cyber-physical systems or for axiomatic economics.

### Solving LRA: Linear Real Arithmetic

We provide an outline of Z3's main procedure for solving formulas over linear real arithmetic [@DutertreM06].
It maintains a (dual) Simplex tableau that encodes equalities of the form $Ax = 0$. 
Feasibility of the equalities depends on bounds, $lo_j \leq x_j \leq hi_j$, 
currently associated with the variables.
For the following formula

```python
  x, y = Reals('x y')
  solve([x >= 0, Or(x + y <= 2, x + 2*y >= 6), 
                 Or(x + y >= 2, x + 2*y > 4)])
```

Z3 introduces auxiliary variables $s_1, s_2$ and represents the formula as

~ MathPre
  s_1 \equiv x + y, s_2 \equiv x + 2y,
  x \geq 0, (s_1 \leq 2 \vee s_2 \geq 6), (s_1 \geq 2 \vee s_2 > 4)
~ 

Only bounds (e.g., $s_1 \leq 2$) are asserted during search.

The first two equalities form the tableau. Thus, the definitions
${s_1} \equiv x + y, {s_2} \equiv x + 2y$
produce the equalities

~ Math 
{s_1} = x + y, \ {s_2} = x + 2y
~

They are equivalent to the normal form:

~ Math
{s_1} - x - y = 0, \   
{s_2} - x - 2y = 0
~  

where ${s_1, s_2}$ are basic (dependent) and $x, y$ are non-basic.
In dual Simplex tableaux, values of a non-basic variable
$x_j$ can be chosen between $lo_j$ and $hi_j$.
The value of a basic variable is a function of non-basic variable values.
It is the unique value that satisfies the unique row where the 
basic variable occurs. Pivoting swaps basic and non-basic variables 
and is used to get values of basic variables within bounds.
For example, assume we start with a set of initial values
$x = y = s_1 = s_2 = 0$
and bounds $x \geq 0, s_1 \leq 2, s_1 \geq 2$. 
Then $s_1$ has to be 2 and it is made non-basic. 
Instead $y$ becomes basic:

~ Math
{y} + x - s_1 = 0, \ {s_2} + x - 2s_1 = 0
~

The new tableau updates the assignment of variables to
$x = 0, s_1 = 2, s_2 = 4, y = 2$. The resulting assignment
is a model for the original formula.

### Solving Arithmetical Fragments

The solvers available to reason about arithmetical constraints are wildly different
depending on what fragments of arithmetic is used.
We summarize the main fragments, available decision procedures, and examples in 
Table [#tab-arith-theories] where $x, y$ range over reals and $a, b$ range over integers.

There are many more fragments of arithmetic that benefit from specialized solvers. 
We later discuss some of the fragments where integer variables are restricted to the values $\{0, 1\}$
when describing Pseudo-Boolean constraints. 
Other fragments that are _not_ currently handled in Z3 in any special way
include fragments listed in Table [#tab-arith-fragments].

A user of Z3 may appreciate that a domain can be modeled using a fragment of the theory of arithmetic that
is already supported, or belongs to a class where no special support is available. 
On a practical side, it is worth noting that Z3 uses infinite precision arithmetic by default. 
Thus, integers and rationals are represented without rounding. The benefit is that the representation 
ensures soundness of the results, but operations by decision procedures may
end up producing large numerals taking most of the execution time. Thus, users who produce linear arithmetic
constraints with large coefficients or long decimal expansions may face performance barriers.


## Arrays { #sec-arrays }


The declaration
```python
  A = Array('A', IntSort(), IntSort())
```
introduces a constant `A`{language:python} of the array sort mapping
integers to integers. We can solve constraints over arrays, 
such as 

```python
solve(A[x] == x, Store(A, x, y) == A)
```
which produces a solution where `x` necessarily equals `y`.

Z3 treats arrays as function spaces, thus a function
`f(x, y)`{language:python}
can be converted to an array using a $\lambda$
```python
  Lambda([x, y], f(x, y))
```
If `f` has sort $A \times B \rightarrow C$, then 
`Lambda([x, y], f(x, y))`{language:python} has sort
`Array(A, B, C)`{language:python}.
A set of built-in functions are available for
arrays. We summarize them together with their
representation using `Lambda`{language:python}
bindings.

```python
  
  a[i]             # select array 'a' at index 'i'
                   # Select(a, i)
  
  Store(a, i, v)   # update array 'a' with value 'v' at index 'i'
                   # = Lambda(j, If(i == j, v, a[j]))
    
  \(Ks|K\)(D, v)          # constant Array(D, R), where R is sort of 'v'.
                   # = Lambda(j, v)
  
  Map(f, a)        # map function 'f' on values of 'a'
                   # = Lambda(j, f(a[j]))

  Ext(a, b)        # Extensionality
                   # Implies(a[Ext(a, b)] == b[Ext(a, b)], a == b)
```

### Deciding Arrays by Reduction to EUF

Formulas using the combinators `Store, K, Map, Ext` are checked 
for satisfiability by _expanding_ the respective $\lambda$ definitions
on sub-terms. We illustrate how occurrences of `Store`{language:python} 
produce constraints over EUF. In the following, assume we are given a 
solver `s` with ground assertions using arrays.

For each occurrence in `s` of `Store(a, i, v)`{language:python} and `b[j]`{language:python}, 
add the following assertions:

* `s.add(Store(a, i, v)[j] == If(i == j, v, a[j]))`{language:python}
* `s.add(Store(a, i, v)[i] == v)`{language:python}


The theory of arrays is _extensional_. That is, two arrays are 
equal if they behave the same on all selected indices. When Z3 produces
models for quantifier free formulas in the theory of extensional arrays
it ensures that two arrays are equal in a model whenever they behave the same
on all indices.
Extensionality is enforced on array terms $a$, $b$ in `s`
by instantiating the axiom of extensionality.

* `s.add(Implies(ForAll(i, a[i] == b[i]), a == b))`{language:python}

Since the universal quantifier occurs in a negative polarity we can introduce a
Skolem function `Ext` that depends on `a` and `b` and represent the extensionality
requirement as:

* `s.add(Implies(a[Ext(a, b)] == b[Ext(a, b)], a == b))`{language:python}



We can convince ourselves that asserting these additional constraints force models of 
a solver `s` to satisfy the array axioms.
Suppose we are given a model $M$ satisfying all the additional asserted equalities.
These equalities enforce the axioms for `Store` on all indices that occur in `s`. They 
also enforce extensionality between arrays: Two arrays are equal if and only if they
evaluate to the same value on all indices in `s`.

## Bit-Vectors

Let us play with some bit-fiddling.
The resource 
~ Center
<https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html>, 
~
lists a substantial
repertoire of bit-vector operations that can be used as alternatives to potentially more expensive
operations.
Note that modern compilers already contain a vast set of optimizations that automatically perform
these conversions and Z3 can be used to check and synthesize such optimizations [@LopesMNR18].
For example, to test whether a bit-vector is a power of two we can use a combination
of bit-wise operations and subtraction:

```python
def is_power_of_two(x):
    return And(x != 0, 0 == (x & (x - 1)))
x = BitVec('x', 4)
prove(is_power_of_two(x) == Or([x == 2**i for i in range(4)]))
```

The absolute value of a variable can be obtained using addition and xor with a sign bit.
```python
v = BitVec('v',32)
mask = v >> 31
prove(If(v > 0, v, -v) == (v + mask) ^ mask)
```
Notice that the Python variable `mask`{language:python} corresponds to the 
expression `v >> 31`{language:python}, the right arithmetic (signed) shift of `v`.
Notice also, that in classical first-order logic, all operations are _total_.
In particular, for bit-vector arithmetic `-v` is fully specified, in contrast
to, say C, which specifies that `-v` is _undefined_ when `v`
is a signed integer with the value $-2^{31}$.

### Solving bit-vectors
Z3 mostly uses a bit-blasting approach to deciding bit-vectors.
By bit-blasting we refer to a reduction of bit-vector constraints to
propositional logic by treating each bit in a bit-vector as a 
propositional variable.
Let us illustrate how bit-vector addition is compiled to a set of
clauses. The expression `v + w`{language:python}, where `v` and `w`
are bit-vectors is represented by a vector `out` of output bits.
The relation between `v`, `w` and `out` is provided by clauses
the encode a ripple-carry adder seen in Figure [#fig-bvadd]. The encoding uses
an auxiliary vector of _carry bits_ that are internal to the adder.

## Bit-Vector Multiplier Encoding

--->

### Floating Point Arithmetic

Floating points are bit-vectors with an interpretation 
specified by the IEEE floating point standard.

```python
x = FP('x', FPSort(3, 4))
print(10 + x)
```
It declares a floating point number `x` with 3 bits in the exponent and 4 for the significand.
The result of adding 10 to `x` is `1.25*(2**3) + x`{language:python}. We see that 10 is represented
as a floating point number with exponent 3, that is the bit-vector 011. The significand
is 1010.

## Algebraic Datatypes

The theory of first-order algebraic data-types captures the theory of finite trees.
It is characterized by the properties that:

* All trees are finite (occurs check).

* All trees are generated from the constructors (no junk).

* Two trees are equal if and only if they are constructed exactly the same way (no confusion).

A basic example of a binary tree data-type is given in Figure [#fig-dt].

~ Figure { #fig-dt; .align-left; caption : "Binary tree datatypes" }
```python
Tree = Datatype('Tree')
Tree.declare('Empty')
Tree.declare('Node', ('left', Tree), ('data', Z), ('right', Tree))
Tree = Tree.create()
t = Const('t', Tree)
solve(t != Tree.Empty)
```
~

It may produce the solution
```python
[t = Node(Empty, 0, Empty)]
```
Similarly, one can prove that a tree cannot be a part of itself.
```python
prove(t != Tree.Node(t, 0, t))
```

## Sequences and Strings

The theory of strings and sequences extend on the theory of the free monoid
with a few additional functions that are useful for strings and sequences.
A length operation is built-in for strings and sequences, and
there are operations for converting strings to natural numbers and back.

If the lengths of a prefix and suffix of a string add up to the length
of the string, the string itself must be the concatenation of the prefix and suffix:
```python
s, t, u = Strings('s t u')
prove(Implies(And(PrefixOf(s, t), SuffixOf(u, t), 
                  Length(t) == Length(s) + Length(u)), 
             t == Concat(s, u)))
```

One can concatenate single elements to a sequence as units:
```python
s, t = Consts('s t', SeqSort(IntSort()))
solve(Concat(s, Unit(IntVal(2))) == Concat(Unit(IntVal(1)), t))
prove(Concat(s, Unit(IntVal(2))) != Concat(Unit(IntVal(1)), s))
```

There are two solvers available in Z3 for strings. They can be exchanged
by setting the parameter 

* `s.set("smt.string.solver","seq")` with contributions by Thai Trinh, or
* `s.set("smt.string.solver","z3str3")` by Murphy Berzish.


# Interfacing with Solvers { #sec-solver-interfacing }

Solvers maintain a set of formulas and supports satisfiability checking, 
and scope management: Formulas that are added under one scope can be
retracted when the scope is popped. In this section we describe the interface
to solvers. Section [#sec-using-solvers] provides a set of use cases and 
section [#sec-solver-implementations] describes the underlying solver
implementations available in Z3.

## Incrementality
Solvers can be used to check satisfiability of assertions in an incremental way.
An initial set of assertions can be checked for satisiability followed
by additional assertions and checks. Assertions can be retracted using
scopes that are pushed and popped. Under the hood, Z3 uses a one-shot solver
during the first check. If further calls are made into the solver, the default 
behavior is to switch to an _incremental_ solver. The incremental solver 
uses the SMT core, see [#sec-smt-core], by default. For use-cases that don't 
require all features by the SMT core, it may be beneficiary to use specialized
solvers, such as solvers for finite domains (bit-vectors, enumeration types, bounded integers, and Booleans)
as specified using the `QF_FD`{language:smt} logic.

## Scopes
The operations `push`{language:python} and `pop`{language:python} create, respectively revert, 
local scopes. Assertions that are added within a `push`{language:python}
are retracted on a matching `pop`{language:python}. Thus, the following session
results in the verdicts `sat`, `unsat`, and `sat`.
```python
p, q, r = Bools('p q r')
s = Solver()
s.add(Implies(p, q))
s.add(Not(q))
print(s.check())
s.push()
s.add(p)
print(s.check())
s.pop()
print(s.check())
```

## Assumptions
Alternative to scopes, it is possible to check satisfiability under the assumption of a set of literals.
Thus, the session
```python
s.add(Implies(p, q))
s.add(Not(q))
print(s.check(p))
```
also produces the verdict `unsat` as the conjunction of $p \rightarrow q$, $\neg q$, $p$ is `unsat`.
The method `assert_and_track(q, p)`{language:python} has the same effect of adding `Implies(p, q)`{language:python},
and it adds `p` as an implicit assumption. Our running example becomes

```python
p, q = Bools('p q')
s = Solver()
s.add(Not(q))
s.assert_and_track(q, p)
print(s.check())
```

## Cores
We can extract a subset of assumptions used to derive unsatisfiability. 
Such subsets of assumptions are known as _unsatisfiable cores_, 
or simply as a _core_.
In the following example, the unsatisfiable core has the single element `p`. 
The unrelated assumption `v` does not appear in the core.

```python
p, q, r, v = Bools('p q r v')
s = Solver()
s.add(Not(q))
s.assert_and_track(q, p)
s.assert_and_track(r, v)
print(s.check())
print(s.unsat_core())
```

Note that we invoke `s.check()`{language:python} prior to extracting a core.
Cores are only available after the last call to `s.check()`{language:python} produced `unsat`.

By default solvers do not return minimal cores. 
A core is _minimal_ if there is no proper subset that is also a core.
The default behavior can be changed when the solver
corresponds to either the SMT Core or SAT Core
(if the underlying solver is created from a sequence of
pre-processing tactics, core minimization is not guaranteed to take effect).
To force core minimization users can rely on setting the following parameters:

```python
def set_core_minimize(s):
    s.set("sat.core.minimize","true")  # For Bit-vector theories
    s.set("smt.core.minimize","true")  # For general SMT 
```

## Models
When `s.check()`{language:python} returns `sat` Z3 can provide a model that assigns values
to the free constants and functions in the assertions. The current model is accessed
using `s.model()`{language.python} and it offers access to an interpretation of the 
active assertions in `s`. Consider the example:

```python
f = Function('f', Z, Z)
x, y = Ints('x y')
s.add(f(x) > y, f(f(y)) == y)
print(s.check())
print(s.model())
```
A possible model for `s` is:
```python
[y = 0, x = 2, f = [0 -> 3, 3 -> 0, else -> 1]]
```
You can access models. They have a set of entries. 
Each entry maps a constant or function declaration
(constants are treated as nullary functions) to an
interpretation. It maps constants to a constant
expression and it maps functions to a _function interpretation_.
The stub
```python
m = s.model()
for d in m:
    print(d, m[d])
```
iterates over the assignments in a model and produces the output
```python
y 0
x 2
f [0 -> 3, 3 -> 0, else -> 1]
```
Function interpretations comprise a set of entries that specify
how the function behaves on selected argument combinations, and a
_else\_value_ that covers arguments not listed in the entries.
```python
num_entries = m[f].num_entries()
for i in range(num_entries):
    print(m[f].entry(i))
print("else", m[f].else_value())
```
It produces the output
```python
[0, 3]
[3, 0]
else 1
```
The easiest way to access a model is to use the `eval` method
that lets you evaluate arbitrary expressions over a model. 
It reduces expressions to a constant that is consistent with the
way the model interprets the constants and functions. For our model from above
```python
print(m.eval(x), m.eval(f(3)), m.eval(f(4)))
```
produces the output 2, 0, 1. 


## Other Methods

### Statistics
You can gain a sneak peak at what the solver did by extracting statistics.
The call 
```python
print(s.statistics())     
```
displays values of internal counters maintained by the decision procedures.
They are mostly valuable when coupled with a detailed understanding of how
the decision procedures work, but may be used as an introductory view into
the characteristics of a search.
### Proofs
Proof objects, that follow a natural deduction style, 
are available from the Solver interface [@MouraB08b]. 
You have to enable proof production at top level in order to retrieve proofs.
```python
s.set("produce-proofs", True)
s.add(\($\varphi$\))
assert unsat == s.check()
print(s.proof())
```
The granularity of proof objects is on a best-effort basis. 
Proofs for the SMT Core, are relatively fined-grained, while
proofs for procedures that perform quantifier elimination, 
for instance QSAT described in Section [#sec-qsat], are exposed as big opaque 
steps.

### Retrieving Solver State
You can retrieve the current set of assertions in a solver using `s.assertions()`, 
the set of unit literals using `s.units()` and literals that are non-units using
`s.non_units()`. The solver state can be printed to SMT-LIB2 format
using `s.sexpr()`.

### Cloning Solver State
The method `s.translate(ctx)` clones the solver state into a new solver based on the context
that is passed in. It is useful for creating separate non-interferring states of a solver. 


### Loading formulas
The methods `s.from_file` and `s.from_string` adds constraints to a solver state
from a file or string. Files are by default assumed to be in the SMT2 format. 
If a file name ends with `dimacs` they are assumed to be in the DIMACS 
propositional format.

### Consequences { #sec-consequences }
Product configuration systems use constraints to describe
the space of all legal configurations. As parameters
get fixed, fewer and fewer configuration options are available.
For instance, once the model of a car has been fixed, some options
for wheel sizes become unavailable. It is furthermore possible
that only one option is available for some configurations, once
some parameters are fixed. Z3 can be used to answer queries of the form:
Given a configuration space of values $V$, 
when fixing values $V_0 \subseteq V$, what is the largest
subset $V_0\subseteq V_1 \subseteq V$ of values that
become fixed? Furthermore, for some value $v_1$ that is fixed,
provide an explanation, 
in terms of the values that were fixed in $V_0$, 
for why $v_1$ got fixed. The functionality is available
through the `consequences`{language:python} method.

```python
a, b, c, d = Bools('a b c d')

s = Solver()
s.add(Implies(a, b), Implies(c, d))   # background formula
print(s.consequences([a, c],          # assumptions
                     [b, c, d]))      # what is implied?

```
produces the result:

```python
(sat, [Implies(c, c), Implies(a, b), Implies(c, d)])
```

In terms for SAT terminology, consequence finding 
produces the set of all _backbone_ literals. 
It is useful for finding fixed parameters [@JanotaLM15] 
in product configuration settings.

Z3 relies on a procedure that integrates tightly with the CDCL, _Conflict Driven Clause Learning_ [@SilvaS99], 
algorithm, and it contains two implementations of the procedure, one in the SAT core, another
in the SMT core. Section [#sec-cdclT] expands on CDCL and integrations with theories.

### Cubes { #sec-cubes }
You can ask Z3 to suggest a case split or a sequence of case splits through the cubing method.
It can be used for partitioning the search space into sub-problems that can be solved in parallel, 
or alternatively simplify the problem for CDCL engines.
~ Figure { #fig-cubes; caption : "Basic cube and conquer" }
```python
s = SolverFor("QF_FD")
s.add(\($F$\))
s.set("sat.restart.max", 100)
def cube_and_conquer(s):
    for cube in s.cube():
       if len(cube) == 0:
          return unknown
       if is_true(cube[0]):
          return sat     
       is_sat = s.check(cube):
       if is_sat == unknown:
          s1 = s.translate(s.ctx)
          s1.add(cube)
          is_sat = cube_and_conquer(s1)
       if is_sat != unsat:
          return is_sat
    return unsat
```
~

When the underlying solver is based on the SAT Core, see Section [#sec-sat-core], it uses
a lookahead solver to select cubes [@HeuleKWB11]. By default, the cuber produces two branches,
corresponding to a case split on a single literal. The SAT Core based cuber can be configured
to produce cubes that represent several branches. An empty cube indicates a failure, such
as the solver does not support cubing (only the SMT and SAT cores support cubing, and generic
solvers based on tactics do not), or a timeout or resource bound was encountered during cubing.
A cube comprising of the Boolean constant `true` indicates that the state of the solver is
satisfiable. Finally, it is possible for the `s.cube()` method to return an empty set of cubes.
This happens when the state of `s` is unsatisfiable.
Each branch is represented as a conjunction
of literals. The cut-off for branches is configured using

* `sat.lookahead.cube.cutoff`{language:python} 

We summarize some of the configuration parameters that depend on the value of `cutoff` in Table [#tab-lookahead].

The free variable ratio can also be made adaptive using the option `adaptive_freevars`, the ratio is then relative to the free variables in branches that were closed. Other options are `adaptive_psat`, which uses a measure for the probability of satisfiability.

Heuristics used to control which literal is selected in cubes can be configured using the parameter:

# Using Solvers { #sec-using-solvers }
We now describe a collection of algorithms.
They are developed on top of the interfaces 
described in the previous section.

## Blocking evaluations
Models can be used to refine the state of a solver. For example, 
we may wish to invoke the solver in a loop where new calls to 
the solver blocks solutions that evaluate the constants to the exact same assignment.
```python
def block_model(s):
    m = s.model()
    s.add(Or([ f() != m[f] for f in m.decls() if f.arity() == 0]))           
```

## Maximizing Satisfying Assignments
Another use of models is to use them as a guide to a notion of optimal model.
A _maximal satisfying solution_, in short _mss_, for a set of formulas `ps`
is a subset of `ps` that is consistent with respect to the solver state `s`
and cannot be extended to a bigger subset of `ps` without becoming inconsistent
relative to `s`. We provide a procedure, from [@MenciaPM15], 
for finding a maximal satisfying subset in Figure [#fig-mss].
It extends a set `mss` greedily by adding as many satisfied predicates from `ps` 
in each round as possible. If it finds some predicate `p` that it cannot add, it notes that it
is a backbone with respect to the current `mss`. As a friendly hint, 
it includes the negation of `p` 
when querying the solver in future rounds.

~ Figure { #fig-mss; caption: "An algorithm for computing [maximal satisfying subsets](https://github.com/Z3Prover/doc/blob/master/programmingz3/code/mss.py)" }
```python
def tt(s, f): 
    return is_true(s.model().eval(f))

def get_mss(s, ps):
    if sat != s.check():
       return []
    mss = { q for q in ps if tt(s, q) }
    return get_mss(s, mss, ps)

def get_mss(s, mss, ps):
    ps = ps - mss
    backbones = set([])
    while len(ps) > 0:
       p = ps.pop()
       if sat == s.check(mss | backbones | { p }):
          mss = mss | { p } | { q for q in ps if tt(s, q) }
          ps  = ps - mss
       else:
          backbones = backbones | { Not(p) }
    return mss          
```
~


~ Exercise
Suppose `ps` is a list corresponding to digits in a binary number
and `ps` is ordered by most significant digit down. The goal is to
find an mss with the largest value as a binary number. Modify `get_mss` 
to produce such a number.
~

## All Cores and Correction Sets 
The Marco procedure [@liffiton2016fast] combines models and cores in a process
that enumerates all unsatisfiable cores and all maximal
satisfying subsets of a set of formulas `ps` with
respect to solver `s`. It maintains a `map` solver
that tells us which subsets of `ps` are not yet
known to be a superset of a core or a subset of
an `mss`.

~ Figure { #fig-marco; caption: "The [MARCO](https://github.com/Z3Prover/doc/blob/master/programmingz3/code/marco.py) algorithm for computing cores and maximal satisfying assignments" }
```python 
def ff(s, p): 
    return is_false(s.model().eval(p))

def marco(s, ps):
    map = Solver()
    set_core_minimize(s)
    while map.check() == sat:
        seed = {p for p in ps if not ff(map, p)}
        if s.check(seed) == sat:
           mss = get_mss(s, seed, ps)
           map.add(Or(ps - mss))
           yield "MSS", mss
        else:
           mus = s.unsat_core()
           map.add(Not(And(mus)))
           yield "MUS", mus
```
~

Efficiently enumerating cores and correction sets is an active area of research.
Many significant improvements have been developed over the above basic 
implementation [@BacchusK15;@MenciaPM15;@BacchusK16;@PrevitiMJM17;@Alviano17;@NarodytskaBMS18].

## Bounded Model Checking 
Figure [#fig-bmc] illustrates a bounded model checking procedure [@Biere09]
 that takes a transition system as input and checks if a goal is reachable.
Transition systems are described as

~ Math
 \langle \mathit{Init}, \mathit{Trans}, \mathit{Goal}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{Y} \rangle
~
where $\mathit{Init}$ is a predicate over $\mathcal{V}$, that describes the initial states, 
$\mathit{Trans}$ is a transition relation over $\mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{V}'$.
The set of reachable states is the set inductively defined as valuations $s$ of $\mathcal{V}$, such that 
either $s \models \mathit{Init}$ or there is a reachable $s_0$ and values $v$ for $\mathcal{Y}$, 
such that $s_0, v, s \models \mathit{Trans}$. A goal is reachable if there is some reachable
state where $s \models \mathit{Goal}$.

In Python we provide the initial condition as `init`, using variables `xs`, 
the transition `trans` that uses variables `xs, xns, fvs`, and `goal` using variables `xs`.
Bounded model checking unfolds the transition relation `trans` until it can establish that
the goal is reachable. Bounded model checking diverges if `goal` is unreachable.
The function `substitute(e, subst)` takes an expression `e` and a list of pairs `subst` 
of the form `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2),..]`{language:python} 
and replaces variables `x1, x2,..` by `y1, y2,..` in `e`.

~ Figure { #fig-bmc; caption: "[Bounded Model Checking](https://github.com/Z3Prover/doc/blob/master/programmingz3/code/bmc.py) of a transition system" }
```python
index = 0
def fresh(s):
    global index
    index += 1
    return Const("!f%d" % index, s)

def zipp(xs, ys):
    return [p for p in zip(xs, ys)]

def bmc(init, trans, goal, fvs, xs, xns):
    s = Solver()
    s.add(init)
    count = 0
    while True:
        print("iteration ", count)
        count += 1
        p = fresh(BoolSort())
        s.add(Implies(p, goal))
        if sat == s.check(p):
            print (s.model())
            return
        s.add(trans)
        ys = [fresh(x.sort()) for x in xs]
        nfvs = [fresh(x.sort()) for x in fvs]
        trans = substitute(trans, 
                           zipp(xns + xs + fvs, ys + xns + nfvs))
        goal = substitute(goal, zipp(xs, xns))
        xs, xns, fvs = xns, ys, nfvs

```
~

~ Example
Can you count up to 10 if you only visit every 3rd number?
```python
x0, x1 = Consts('x0 x1', BitVecSort(4))
bmc(x0 == 0, x1 == x0 + 3, x0 == 10, [], [x0], [x1])
```
~

Bounded model checking is good for establishing reachability, but does not
produce certificates for non-reachability (or safety). The IC3 [@BradleyM07] 
algorithm is complete for both reachability and non-reachability. 
You can find a simplistic implementation of IC3 using the Python API online

## Propositional Interpolation

It is possible to compute interpolants using models and cores [@ChocklerIM12].
A procedure that computes an interpolant $I$ for formulas $A$, $B$, where
$A \land B$ is unsatisfiable proceeds by initializing $I = \true$ and 
saturating a state $\lceil A, B, I \rceil$ with respect to the rules:


~ MathPre
 \lceil A, B, I \rceil & \Longrightarrow & \lceil A, B, I \land \neg L\rceil &        \mbox{if} & B \vdash \neg L, A \land I\not\vdash \neg L \\
                       &                 & I                                 &        \mbox{if} & A \vdash \neg I %\\
~

The partial interpolant $I$ produced by pogo satisfies $B \vdash I$. It terminates when $A \vdash \neg I$.
The condition $A \land I \not\vdash \neg L$ ensures that the algorithm makes progress and suggests using an implicant $L' \supseteq L$ of $A \land I$ in each iteration. Such an implicant can be obtained from a model for $A \land I$.

~ Figure { #fig-interpolate; caption : "[Propositional interpolation](https://github.com/Z3Prover/doc/blob/master/programmingz3/code/interp.py)" }
```python
def mk_lit(m, x):
    if is_true(m.eval(x)):
       return x
    else:
       return Not(x)

def pogo(A, B, xs):   
    while sat == A.check():
       m = A.model()
       L = [mk_lit(m, x) for x in xs]
       if unsat == B.check(L):
          notL = Not(And(B.unsat_core()))
          yield notL
          A.add(notL)
       else:
          print("expecting unsat")
          break
```
~

~ Example
The (reverse) interpolant between $A: x_1 = a_1 \neq a_2 \neq x_2$ and $B: x_1 = b_1 \neq b_2 = x_2$
using vocabulary $x_1, x_2$ is $x_1 \neq x_2$. It is implied by $B$ and inconsistent with $A$.
```python
A = SolverFor("QF_FD")
B = SolverFor("QF_FD")
a1, a2, b1, b2, x1, x2 = Bools('a1 a2 b1 b2 x1 x2')
A.add(a1 == x1, a2 != a1, a2 != x2)
B.add(b1 == x1, b2 != b1, b2 == x2)
print(list(pogo(A, B, [x1, x2])))
```

## Monadic Decomposition 

Suppose we are given a formula $\varphi[x, y]$ using variables $x$ and $y$.
When is it possible to rewrite it as a Boolean combination of formulas
$\psi_1(x), \ldots, \psi_k(x)$ and $\theta_1(y), \ldots, \theta_n(y)$?
We say that the formulas $\psi_j$ and $\theta_j$ are _monadic_; they
only depend on one variable. An application of monadic decomposition
is to convert _extended_ symbolic finite transducers into _regular_ symbolic
finite transducers. The regular versions are amenable to analysis and optimization.
A procedure for monadic decomposition
was developed in [@VeanesBNB17], and we here recall the Python prototype. 

~ Figure { #fig-mondec; caption : "[Monadic Decomposition](https://github.com/Z3Prover/doc/blob/master/programmingz3/code/mondec.py)" }
```python
from z3 import *
def nu_ab(R, x, y, a, b):
    x_ = [ Const("x_%d" %i, x[i].sort()) for i in range(len(x))]
    y_ = [ Const("y_%d" %i, y[i].sort()) for i in range(len(y))]
    return Or(Exists(y_, R(x+y_) != R(a+y_)), Exists(x_, R(x_+y) != R(x_+b)))

def isUnsat(fml):
    s = Solver(); s.add(fml); return unsat == s.check()

def lastSat(s, m, fmls):
    if len(fmls) == 0: return m
    s.push(); s.add(fmls[0])
    if s.check() == sat: m = lastSat(s, s.model(), fmls[1:])       
    s.pop(); return m

def mondec(R, variables):
    print(variables)
    phi = R(variables);    
    if len(variables)==1: return phi
    l = int(len(variables)/2)
    x, y = variables[0:l], variables[l:]
    def dec(nu, pi):
        if isUnsat(And(pi, phi)): 
           return BoolVal(False)
        if isUnsat(And(pi, Not(phi))): 
           return BoolVal(True)
        fmls = [BoolVal(True), phi, pi] 
        #try to extend nu
        m = lastSat(nu, None, fmls)              
        #nu must be consistent 
        assert(m != None)                         
        a = [ m.evaluate(z, True) for z in x ]
        b = [ m.evaluate(z, True) for z in y ]
        psi_ab = And(R(a+y), R(x+b))
        phi_a = mondec(lambda z: R(a+z), y)
        phi_b = mondec(lambda z: R(z+b), x)
        nu.push()
        #exclude: x~a and y~b
        nu.add(nu_ab(R, x, y, a, b))              
        t = dec(nu, And(pi, psi_ab)) 
        f = dec(nu, And(pi, Not(psi_ab)))
        nu.pop()
        return If(And(phi_a, phi_b), t, f)
    #nu is initially true
    return dec(Solver(), BoolVal(True))             
```
~

~ Example
A formula that has a monadic decomposition is 
the bit-vector assertion for $x$, $y$ being bit-vectors of bit-width $2k$.
~~ Math
   y > 0 \land (y \& (y - 1)) = 0 \land (x \& (y \% ((1 << k) - 1))) \neq 0
~~
We can compute the monadic decomposition
```python
def test_mondec(k):                             
    R = lambda v:And(v[1] > 0, (v[1] & (v[1] - 1)) == 0,
                     (v[0] & (v[1] % ((1 << k) - 1))) != 0)
    bvs = BitVecSort(2*k)                        #use 2k-bit bitvectors
    x, y = Consts('x y', bvs)
    res = mondec(R, [x, y])
    assert(isUnsat(res != R([x, y])))             #check correctness 
    print("mondec1(", R([x, y]), ") =", res)
test_mondec(2)
```

# Solver Implementations { #sec-solver-implementations }

There are five main solvers embedded in Z3.
The SMT Solver is a general purpose solver that covers a wide range of supported theories.
It is supplemented with specialized solvers for SAT formulas, polynomial arithmetic, 
Horn clauses and quantified formulas over theories that admit quantifier-elimination.

## SMT Core { #sec-smt-core }

The SMT Solver is a general purpose solver that covers a wide range of 
supported theories. It is built around a CDCL(T) architecture where theory
solvers interact with a SAT + EUF blackboard. 
Theory solvers, on the right in Figure [#fig-z3core], communicate
with a core that exchanges equalities between variables and assignments
to atomic predicates. The core is responsible for case splitting, which
is handled by a CDCL SAT solver, and for letting each theory learn constraints
and equalities that are relevant in the current branch.

To force using the SMT solver a user can create 
a _simple solver_ using the function `SimpleSolver`{language:python}.

The SMT solver integrates two strategies for quantifier instantiation.
By default, both strategies are enabled. To disable them, one has to
disable automatic configuration mode and then disable the instantiation
strategy:
```python
s.set("smt.auto_config", False)   # disable automatic SMT core
                                  # configuration 
s.set("smt.mbqi", False)          # disable model based 
                                  # quantifier instantiation
s.set("smt.ematching", False)     # disable ematching based 
                                  # quantifier instantiation
```

### CDCL(T): SAT + Theories { #sec-cdclT }

The architecture of mainstream SMT solvers, including Z3's SMT core, uses
a SAT solver to enumerate combinations of truth assignments to atoms.
The truth assignments satisfy a propositional abstraction of the formula.
Theory solvers are used to check if assignment admit a model modulo
the theories. The resulting architecture is known as DPLL(T) [@dpllt], 
but we refer to this as CDCL(T) because it really relies on SAT solvers
that incorporate _Conflict Driven Clause Learning_ [@SilvaS99], 
which goes beyond the algorithm associated with DPLL [@dpll].
Importantly, CDCL supplies facilities for learning new clauses during search.
The learned clauses block future case splits from exploring the same failed
branches. 
Take the following example
```python
s.add(x >= 0, y == x + 1, Or(y > 2, y < 1))
```
by introducing the names:
```python
p1, p2, p3, p4 = Bools('p1 p2 p3 p4')
#              = x >= 0, y == x + 1, y > 2, y < 1
```
we obtain a propositional formula
```python
And(p1, p2, Or(p3, p4))
```
It is satisfiable and a possible truth assignment is
```python
p1, p2, p3, p4 = True, True, False, True
```
It requires satisfiability of the following 
conjunction:
```python
x >= 0, y == x + 1, Not(y > 2), y < 1
```
It is already the case that
```python
x >= 0, y == x + 1, y < 1
```
is `unsat`. To avoid this assignment we 
require also satisfying the blocking clause
```python
Or(Not(p1), Not(p2), Not(p4))
```
The new truth assignment 
```python
p1, p2, p3, p4 = True, True, True, False
```
produces
```python
x >= 0, y == x + 1, y > 2, Not(y < 1)
```
which is satisfiable.
The example illustrates the steps used in a CDCL(T)
integration where the Theory Solver 
processes the final result of a SAT Solver. 
We can simulate this procedure using Z3's API.
Figure [#simple-cdclT] shows a CDCL(T) solver
that leverages a propositional solver `prop` to 
check a propositional abstraction and a theory solver
`theory` whose role is to check conjunctions of literals
produced by `prop`. Figure [#cdclT-aux] lists auxiliary
routines required to create the abstraction.

We call it a _simple_ CDCL(T) solver as it does not
expose important features to drive performance.
Importantly, efficient CDCL(T) solvers integrate 
_theory propagation_ that let theories interact with
the SAT solver to propagate assignments to atoms. 
Instead of adding blocking clauses by the time the SAT
solver is done the theory solver interacts tightly with
the SAT solver during back-jumping. 

~ Exercise
__Dual propagation and implicants__:
The propositional assignment produced by `prop` is not necessarily
minimal. It may assign truth assignments to literals that are irrelevant
to truth of the set of clauses. To extract a smaller assignment, 
one trick is to encode the _negation_ of the clauses in a 
separate _dual_ solver. A truth assignment for the _primal_ solver
is an unsatisfiable core for the _dual_ solver. 
The exercise is to augment `simple_cdclT`{language:python} with a
dual solver to reduce assignments sent to the theory solver.

### Theories + Theories

In practice we need to solve a combination of theories.
The formulas we used in the initial example

```python
  x + 2 == y, f(Store(A, x, 3)[y - 2]) != f(y - x + 1)
```
integrate several theory solvers. For modularity, 
it is desirable to maintain
separate solvers per theory. To achieve this
objective the main questions that an integration needs to address are:

* Determine when the union of two theories $\Th_1 \cup \Th_2$ is consistent.
* Given solvers for $\Th_1$ and $\Th_2$, 
  how can we build a solver for $\Th_1 \cup \Th_2$.

We can address this objective when there
is an _effective_ theory $\Th_0$ over the shared signature of $\Th_1, \Th_2$, 
that when embedable into $\Th_1, \Th_2$ implies
$\Th_1 \cup \Th_2$ is consistent. Sufficient conditions for this 
setting were identified by Nelson and Oppen [@NelsonO79]:

~ Theorem 
The union of two consistent, disjoint, stably infinite theories is consistent.
~

Let us define the ingredients of this theorem.

#### Disjoint Theories

Two theories are disjoint if they do not share function/constant and predicate symbols.
$=$ is the only exception. For example,

* The theories of arithmetic and arrays are disjoint. 
* Arithmetic symbols: `0, -1, 1, -2, 2, +, -, *, >, <, ==, >=`{language:python}.
* Array symbols: `Select, Store`{language:python}

The process of _purification_ can be used as a formal tool to bring 
formulas into signature-disjoint form. It introduces fresh symbols for 
shared sub-terms. A purified version of our running example is:

```python
Functions:  f(v1) != f(v2)
Arrays:     v1 == v3[v4], v3 == Store(x, y, v5)
Arithmetic: x + 2 == y, v2 == y - x + 1, v4 == y - 2, v5 == 2
```

In reality, purification is a no-op: the fresh variables correspond directly to 
nodes in the abstract syntax trees for expressions.
 
#### Stably Infinite Theories

A theory is stably infinite if every satisfiable 
quantifier-free formula is satisfiable in an infinite model.

* EUF and arithmetic are stably infinite.

* Bit-vectors are not.


#### Nelson-Oppen combination.
Let $\Th_1$ and $\Th_2$ be consistent, stably infinite theories
over disjoint (countable) signatures. Assume satisfiability of conjunction of
literals can be decided in $O(\Th_1(n))$ and
$O(\Th_2(n))$ time respectively.
Then

1. The combined theory $\Th$ is consistent and stably infinite.

2. Satisfiability of quantifier free conjunction of literals can be decided
in $O(2^{n^2} \times (\Th_1(n) + \Th_2(n)))$.

3. If $\Th_1$ and $\Th_2$ are _convex_, then so is
$\Th$ and satisfiability in $\Th$ can be decided
in $O(n^3 \times (\Th_1(n) + \Th_2(n)))$.

#### Convexity.
A theory $\Th$ is _convex_ if for every finite sets $S$ of literals, and every disjunction $a_1 = b_1 \vee \ldots \vee a_n = b_n$:

~ MathPre
   S \models a_1 = b_1 \vee \ldots \vee a_n = b_n  iff S \models a_i = b_i for some 1 \leq i \leq n.
~ 

Many theories are convex and therefore admit efficient theory combinations

* Linear Real Arithmetic is convex.

* Horn equational theories are convex.
   * Horn equations are formulas of the form $a_1 \neq b_1 \vee \ldots a_n \neq b_n \vee a = b$.

Finally note that every convex theory with non trivial models is stably infinite.

But, far from every theory is convex. Notably, 

* Integer arithmetic
  * $1 \leq a \leq 2, b = 1, c = 2$ implies $a = b \vee a = c$.

* Real non-linear arithmetic
  * $a^2 = 1, b = 1, c = -1$ implies $a = b \vee a = c$.

* The theory of arrays
  * `Store(a, i, v)[j] == v` implies `i == j` or `a[j] == v`.

#### A Reduction Approach to Theory Combination [@KapurZarbaReduction;@MouraB09].
Theory Combination in Z3 is essentially by reduction to a set of 
core theories comprising of Arithmetic, EUF and SAT.
Bit-vectors and finite domains translate to propositional SAT.
Other theories are _reduced_ to core theories. We provided an 
example of this reduction in Section [#sec-arrays].


### E-matching and Pattern based quantifier instantiation 

E-matching [@MouraB07] based quantifier instantiation uses ground terms 
to find candidate instantiations of quantifiers.
Take the example
```python
a, b, c, x = Ints('a b c x')
f = Function('f', Z, Z)
g = Function('g', Z, Z, Z)
prove(Implies(And(ForAll(x, f(g(x, c)) == a), b == c, g(c, b) == c),
              f(b) == a))
```
The smallest sub-term that properly contains `x` is `g(x, c)`.
This _pattern_ contains all the bound variables of the 
universal quantifier. 
Under the ground equality `b == c` and instantiation of
`x` by `c`, it equals `g(c, b)`. This triggers an instantiation
by the following tautology
```python
Implies(ForAll(x, f(g(x, c)) == a), f(g(c, c)) == a))
```
Chasing the equalities `f(g(c, c)) == a, g(c, b) == c, b == c`
we derive `f(b) == a`, which proves the implication.

The example illustrated that E-matching takes as 
starting point a _pattern_ term $p$, that captures the 
variables bound by a quantifier.  It derives 
an substitution $\theta$, such that $p\theta$ 
equals some _useful_ term $t$, modulo some _useful_ equalities.
A useful source of _useful_ terms are the current ground terms $\mathcal{T}$ maintained during search,
and the current asserted equalities during search may be used as the _useful_ equalities.
The _congruence closure_ structure _cc_ introduced in Section [#sec-cc] contains relevant
information to track ground equalities. For each ground term it 
represents an equivalence class of terms that are congruent 
in the current context. Now, given a pattern 
$p$ we can compute a set of substitutions modulo the current 
congruence closure by invoking 

~ Math
  \bigcup_{t \in \mathcal{T}} match(p, t, \emptyset)
~ 

where E-matching is defined by recursion on the pattern $p$:

~MathPre

 match(x, t, S)     &  =    & \{ \theta[x \mapsto t] \;\mid\; \theta \in S, x \not\in \theta \} 
                    &       & \cup  \{ \theta \;\mid\; \theta \in S, x \in \theta, \theta(x) \in cc(t) \}
 match(c, t, S)     &  =    & \emptyset\                 \mathsf{if} c \not\in cc(t)
 match(c, t, S)     &  =    & S                 \mathsf{if} c \in cc(t)
 match(f(\vec{p}), t, S) &  =    & \bigcup_{f(\vec{t}) \in cc(t)} match(\vec{p}_n, \vec{t}_n, \ldots, match(\vec{p}_1, \vec{t}_1, S))
~

It is not always possible to capture all quantified variables in a single pattern.
For this purpose E-matching is applied to a sequence of patterns, known as a _multi-pattern_ 
that collectively contain all bound variables. 

The secret sauce to efficiency is to find instantiations

 * with as little overhead as possible, 
 * across large sets of terms, and 
 * incrementally.

Z3 uses code-trees [@RamakrishnanSV01] to address scale bottlenecks for search involving 
thousands of patterns and terms. 

### Model-Based Quantifier Instantiation 

E-matching provides a highly syntactic restriction on instantiations. 
An alternative to E-matching is based on using a current model of the quantifier-free part of 
the search state. It is used to evaluate the universal quantifiers that have to be satisfied
in order for the current model to extend to a full model of the conjunction of all
asserted constraints. We call this method _Model-Based Quantifier Instantiation_
[@GeM09;@MouraB10;@BonacinaLM11;@WintersteigerHM13].
Take the following example:

```python
from z3 import *
Z = IntSort()
f = Function('f', Z, Z)
g = Function('g', Z, Z)
a, n, x = Ints('a n x')
solve(ForAll(x, Implies(And(0 <= x, x <= n), f(x + a) == g(x))),
      a > 10, f(a) >= 2, g(3) <= -10)
```
It may produce a model of the form
```python
[a = 11,
 n = 0,
 f = [else -> 2],
 g = [3 -> -10, else -> f(Var(0) + 11)]]
```

The interpretation of `g` maps 3 to -10, and all other values $x$ are mapped
to however $f(11 + x)$ is interpreted (which happens to be the constant 2).

The method that allowed finding this satisfying assignment
is based on a model evaluation loop. At a high level it can
be described as the following procedure, which checks
satisfiability of 

~ Math
\psi \land \forall x \ . \ \varphi[{x}]
~
where $\psi$ is quantifier free and for sake of illustration we have
a single quantified formula with quantifier free body $\varphi$.
The Model-Based Quantifier Instantiation, MBQI, procedure is 
described in Figure [#fig-mbqi]:

~ Figure { #fig-mbqi; caption:"Model-Based Quantifier Instantiation algorithm. Notice that this proto-algorithm code is not directly executable." }
```python
s.add(\($\psi$\))
while True:
   if unsat == s.check():
      return unsat
   M = s.model()
   checker = Solver()
   checker.add(\($\neg \varphi^M[{x}]$\))
   if unsat == checker.check():
      return sat
   M = checker.model()
   find \($t$\), such that \($x \not\in t, t^M = x^M$\).
   s.add(\($\varphi[t]$\))
```
~

We use the notation $t^M$ to say that $t$ is 
partially evaluated using interpretation $M$, for example:

* Let $M := [y \mapsto 3, f(x) \mapsto \mathit{if}\ x = 1\ \mathit{then}\ 3\ \mathit{else} \ 5]$, and

* $t :=  y + f(y) + f(z)$, then 

* $t^M = 3 + 5 + \mathit{if}\ z = 1\ \mathit{then}\ 3\ \mathit{else} \ 5$

For our example formula assume we have a model of the quantifier-free constraints
as follows
```python
[a = 11, n = 0, f = [else -> 2], g = [else -> -10]]
```
The negated body of the quantifier, instantiated to the model is
```python
And(0 <= x, x <= 0, [else -> 2](x + 11) != [else -> -10](x))
```
It is satisfied with the instantiation `x = 0`, which is congruent to `n` under the current model.
We therefore instantiate the quantifier with `x = n` and add the constraint
```python
Implies(And(0 <= n, n <= n), f(n + a) == g(n))
```
But notice a syntactic property of the quantifier body. It can be 
read as a definition for the graph of `g` over the range `0 <= x, x <= n`.
This format is an instance of _guarded definitions_ [@IhlemannJS08]. 
Hence, we record this reading when creating the next model for `g`. 
In the next round, `a`, `n`, and `f` are instantiated as before, 
and `g(3)` evaluates to -10 as before, but elsewhere follows the graph of
`f(x + a)`, and thus the model for `g` is given by `[3 -> -10, else -> f(11 + Var(0))]`{language:python}.

Model-Based Quantifier Instantiation 
is quite powerful when search space for instantiation terms is finite. 
It covers many decidable logical fragments, including EPR (Effectively Propositional Reasoning), UFBV 
(uninterpreted functions and bit-vectors), 
the Array property fragment [@BradleyMS06] and extensions [@GeM09]. 
We will here only give a taste with an example from UFBV [@WintersteigerHM13]:


```python
Char = BitVecSort(8)
f  = Function('f', Char, Char)
f1 = Function('f1', Char, Char)
a, x = Consts('a x', Char)
solve(UGE(a, 0), f1 (a + 1) == 0, 
      ForAll(x, Or(x == a + 1, f1(x) == f(x))))
```

The following model is a possible solution:
```python
[a = 0, f = [else -> 1], f1 = [1 -> 0, else -> f(Var(0))]]
```

`UFBV`{language:smt} is the quantified logic of uninterpreted functions of bit-vectors.
All sorts and variables have to be over bit-vectors, and standard bit-vector operations are allowed.
It follows that the problem is finite domain and therefore decidable. 
It isn't easy, however. The quantifier-free fragment is not only NP hard, 
it is NEXPTIME hard; it can be encoded into EPR [@SeidlLB12].
The quantified fragment is another complexity jump.
Related to `UFBV`{language:smt}, decision procedures for quantified bit-vector formulas were 
developed by John and Chakraborty in [@JohnC16;@JohnC13;@JohnC11], and by Niemetz et al
in [@NiemetzPRBT18].

Recall taht EPR is a fragment of first-order logic where formulas have the quantifier
prefix $\exists \vec{x} \forall \vec{y}$, thus a block of existential quantified variables
followed by a block of universally quantified variables. The formula inside the quantifier prefix
is a Boolean combination of equalities, disequalities between bound variables and free constants
as well as predicate symbols applied to bound variables or free constants. Noteworthy, EPR formulas
do not contain functions. It is easy to see that EPR is decidable by first replacing the existentially quantified
variables by fresh constants and then instantiate the universally quantified variables by all combinations of the
free constant. If the resulting ground formula is satisfiable, we obtain a finite model of the quantified
formula by bounding the size of the universe by the free constants. The formula $\exists x \forall y . (p(x, y) \lor q(a, y) \lor y = a)$,
where $a$ is a free constant, is in EPR.



## SAT Core { #sec-sat-core }

The SAT Core is an optimized self-contained SAT solver that solves propositional 
formulas. It takes advantage of the fact that it operates over propositional theories
and performs advanced in-processing steps.
The SAT solver also acts as a blackboard for select Boolean predicates
that express cardinality and arithmetical (pseudo-Boolean) constraints over 
literals. 

Generally, theories that are finite domain, are solved using the SAT solver.
Z3 identifies quantifier-free finite domain theories using a designated logic `QF_FD`{language:smt}.
It supports propositional logic, bit-vector theories, pseudo-Boolean constraints, and enumeration 
data-types. For example, the following scenario introduces an enumeration
type for color, and bit-vectors `u`, `v`. It requires that at least 2 out of
three predicates `u + v <= 3, v <= 20, u <= 10` are satisfied.
```python
from z3 import *
s = SolverFor("QF_FD")
Color, (red, green, blue) = EnumSort('Color', ['red','green','blue'])
clr = Const('clr', Color)
u, v = BitVecs('u v', 32)
s.add(u >= v,
      If(v > u + 1, clr != red, clr != green),
      clr == green,
      AtLeast(u + v <= 3, v <= 20, u <= 10, 2))
print(s.check())
print(s.model())
```
is satisfiable, and a possible model is:
```python
[v = 4, u = 2147483647, clr = green]
```

Figure [#fig-satcore] shows the overall architecture of Z3's SAT solver.

--->

There are four main components. Central to the SAT solver is an engine that performs
case splits, lemma learning and backtracking search. It is the main CDCL engine
and is structured similar to mainstream CDCL solvers. It can draw on auxiliary 
functionality. 

### In-processing
In-processing provides a means for the SAT solver to 
simplify the current set of clauses using _global_ inferences.
In-processing is performed on a periodic basis. It integrates several 
of the techniques that have been developed in the SAT solving literature
in the past decade, known as Blocked Clause Elimination, 
Asymmetric Literal Addition, Asymmetric Covered Clause Elimination, 
Subsumption, Asymmetric Branching [@HeuleJLSB15].

### Co-processing
A set of co-processors are available to support alternative means
of search. The SAT Core solver can also be a co-processor of itself.

* `s.set("sat.local_search_threads", 3)`{language:python} spawns 3 concurrent threads that use
   walk-sat to find a satisfying assignment while the main CDCL solver attempts to find
   either a satisfying assignment or produce an empty clause. 
* `s.set("sat.threads", 3)`{language:python} spawns 2 concurrent threads, in additional 
   to the main thread, to find a proof of the empty clause or a satisfying assignment. 
   The threads share learned unit literals and learned clauses.
* `s.set("sat.unit_walk_threads", 1)`{language:python} spawns 1 concurrent thread that uses
  a local search heuristic that integrates unit propagation. 
* `s.set("sat.lookahead_simplify", True)`{language:python} enables the lookahead solver as a 
  simplifier during in-processing. It enables slightly more powerful techniques for learning new units and binary clauses.

The lookahead solver is used to find case splits through the Cube features, described in Section [#sec-cubes].
  
### Boolean Theories
Three classes of Boolean functions are supported using specialized Boolean theory handlers. They are optional, as 
many problems can already be solved using the SAT core where the functions have been clausified.
The cardinality and Pseudo-Boolean theory handlers are suitable for constraints where the 
encoding into clauses causes a significant overhead. The Xor solver is unlikely to be worth using, 
but is available for evaluation.

#### Cardinality Constraints
Cardinality constraints are linear inequalities of the form
~ Math
	\sum_{i=1}^n F_i \geq k, \ \sum_{i=1}^n F_i \leq k 
~
where $F_i$ are formulas and $k$ is a constant between 1 and $n$.
They say that at least $k$ of the $F_i$;s have to hold,
and at most $k$ of the $F_i$'s hold, respectively.
Cardinality constraints do not have to appear at top-level in formulas.
They can be nested in arbitrary sub-formulas and they can contain arbitrary formulas. 
For instance, 
```python
p, q, r, u = Bools('p q r u')
solve(AtMost(p, q, r, 1), u, 
      Implies(u, AtLeast(And(p, r), Or(p, q), r, 2)))
```
has no solution.

The cardinality solver is enabled by setting the parameter

* `s.set("sat.cardinality.solver", True)`{language:python} 

If the parameter is false, cardinality constraints are compiled to clauses.
A few alternative encoding methods are made available, and they 
can be controlled using the parameter `sat.cardinality.encoding`.


#### Pseudo-Boolean Constraints
Pseudo-Boolean constraints generalize cardinality constraints by allowing coefficients
in the linear inequalities. They are of the form
~ Math
	\sum_{i=1}^n a_iF_i \geq k, \ \sum_{i=1}^n a_iF_i \leq k 
~
where $a_i$ are positive natural numbers. A value of $a_i$ above $k$ is legal, but
can be safely truncated to $k$ without changing the meaning of the formulas.

The constraints
~ Math
	p + 2q + 2r \leq 2 \land p + 2u + 3r \geq 4 \land u
~
can be written as
```python
solve(PbLe([(p,1),(q,2),(r,2)], 3), 
      PbGe([(p,1),(u,2),(r,3)], 4),
      u)
```
and have a solution
```python
[q = False, u = True, r = True]
```

The pseudo-Boolean solver is enabled by setting the parameter

* `s.set("sat.pb.solver", "solver")`{language:python}

Other available options for compiling Pseudo-Boolean constraints are `circuit`, `sorting`, and `totalizer`.
They compile Pseudo-Booleans into clauses.

## Horn Clause Solver

The Horn Solver contains specialized solvers for _Constrained Horn Clauses_ 
[@HoderMB11;@Rybal12;@HoderB12;@McMillan14;@BjornerGMR15]. 
As a default it uses the
SPACER Horn clause solver by Arie Gurfinkel to solve Horn clauses over arithmetic [@KomuravelliGC14].
A Constrained Horn Clause is a disjunction of literals over a set of uninterpreted 
predicates and interpreted functions and interpreted predicates (such as arithmetical 
operations `+` and relations `<=`). The uninterpreted predicates, 
may occur negatively without restrictions, but only occur positively in at most one place.

The solver also contains a Datalog engine that can be used to solve Datalog queries
(with stratified negation) over finite domains and "header spaces" that are large finite
domains, but can be encoded succinctly using ternary bit-vectors. The `Fixedpoint`{language:python}
context contains facilities for building Horn clauses, and generally a set of stratified Datalog rules, 
and for querying the resulting set of rules and facts.
Additional
information on the Fixedpoint engine can be found on <https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial/fixedpoints>.

We provide a very simple illustration of Horn clause usage here. McCarthy's 91 function illustrates
nested recursion in a couple of lines, but otherwise makes no sense: It computes a function
that can be described directly as 
```python
    If(x > 101, 91, x - 10).
```
We will pretend this is a partial and interesting 
specification and prove this automatically using Horn clauses.
```python
def mc(x):
    if x > 100:
       return x - 10
    else:
       return mc(mc(x + 11))

def contract(x):
    assert(x > 101 or mc(x) == 91)
    assert(x < 101 or mc(x) == x - 10)
```

Rewriting the functional program into logical form can be achieved
by introducing a binary relation between the input and output of `mc`, 
and then representing the functional program as a logic program, that is,
a set of Horn clauses. The assertions are also Constrained Horn Clauses:
they contain the uninterpreted predicate `mc` negatively, but have no
positive occurrences of `mc`.

```python
s = SolverFor("HORN")
mc = Function('mc', Z, Z, B)
x, y, z = Ints('x y z')
s.add(ForAll(x, Implies(x > 100, mc(x, x - 10))))
s.add(ForAll([x, y, z], 
             Implies(And(x <= 100, mc(x + 11, y), mc(y, z)), 
                     mc(x, z))))
s.add(ForAll([x, y], Implies(And(x <= 101, mc(x, y)), y == 91)))
s.add(ForAll([x, y], Implies(And(x >= 101, mc(x, y)), x == y + 10)))
print(s.check())
```
Z3 finds a solution for `mc` that is a sufficient invariant to establish the
assertions.

We get a better view of the invariant for `mc` by 
evaluating it on symbolic inputs `x` and `y`.
```python
print(s.model().eval(mc(x, y)))
```
produces the invariant
```python
And(Or(Not(y >= 92), Not(x + -1*y <= 9)),
    Not(x + -1*y >= 11),
    Not(y <= 90))
```

## QSAT { #sec-qsat }

The QSAT Solver is a decision procedure for satisfiability of select theories that 
admit quantifier elimination. It can be used to check satisfiability of quantified formulas
over Linear Integer (Figure [#fig-qsat-lia]), Linear Real (Figure [#fig-qsat-lra]), 
Non-linear (polynomial) real arithmetic (Figure [#fig-qsat-nra]), Booleans, and
algebraic data-types (Figure [#fig-qsat-dt]). It is described in [@BjornerJ15].
It is invoked whenever a solver is created for one of the supported quantified logics, or
 a solver is created from the `qsat` tactic.

~ Figure { #fig-qsat-lia; caption:"Given a supply of 5 and 7 cent stamps. Is there a lower bound, after which all denominations of stamps can be produced?" }

a = 5

s.add(ForAll(u, Implies(u >= v, 
                        Exists([x, y], And(x >= 0, y >= 0, u == a*x + b*y)))))
print(s.check())

```

def move(x, y):
    return Or(x == S(y), x == S(S(y)))

    if n == 0:
        return False

    return Exists(y, And(move(x, y), Not(win(y, n - 1))))

s.add(win(S(S(S(S(Z)))), 4))
print(s.check())
```
~
Figure [#fig-qsat-dt] encodes a simple game introduced in [@ColmerauerD00]. There is no SMT-LIB2 logic for quantified
algebraic data-types so we directly instantiate the solver that performs QSAT through a tactic. Section [#sec-tactics]
provides a brief introduction to tactics in Z3.

The solver builds on an abstraction refinement loop, originally developed
for quantifier elimination in [@Monniaux08]. The goal of 
the procedure is, given a quantifier-free $f$, 
find a quantifier free $G$, such that $G \equiv \exists \vec{v} \;.\; F$.
It assumes a tool, _project_, that eliminates $\vec{v}$ from a conjunction $M$
into a satisfiable strengthening.
That is, project($\vec{v}, M$) $\Rightarrow \ \exists\vec{v}\; .\; M$.
The procedure, uses the steps:

* __Initialize__: $G \leftarrow \bot$

* __Repeatedly__: find conjunctions $M$ that imply $F \wedge \neg G$

* __Update__: $G \leftarrow G \vee \mbox{project}(\vec{v}, M)$.

An algorithm that realizes this approach is formulated in Figure [#fig-monniaux].

~ Figure { #fig-monniaux; caption : "Quantifier elimination by core extraction and projection. Notice that this proto-algorithm code is not directly executable" }
```python
def qe(\($\exists \vec{v} \ . \ F$\)):                   
    e, a = Solver(), Solver()
    e.add(\($F$\))                        
    a.add(\($\neg F$\))
    \($G$\) = False
    while sat == e.check():
       \($M_0$\) = e.model()
       \($M_1$\) = [ lit for lit in literals(F) if is_true(\($M_0$\).eval(lit)) ]
       # \(#comment|assume $F$ is in negation normal form\)
       assert unsat == a.check(\($M_1$\)) 
       \($M_2$\) = a.unsat_core()
       \($\pi$\) = project(\($M_2$\), \($\vec{v}$\))
       \($G$\) = \($G \vee \pi$\)
       e.add(\($\neg\pi$\))
    return \($G$\)
```
~

QESTO [@JanotaM15] generalizes this procedure to nested QBF 
(Quantified Boolean Formulas), and
the implementation in Z3 generalizes QESTO to SMT. 
The approach is based on playing a quantifier game.
Let us illustrate the game for Boolean formulas.
Assume we are given:
~MathPre
G  =  \forall u_1, u_2 \exists e_1, e_2 \ . \ F \\
F  =  (u_1 \land u_2 \rightarrow  e_1) \land (u_1 \land \neg u_2 \rightarrow e_2) \land(e_1 \land e_2 \rightarrow \neg u_1)
~

Then the game proceeds as follows:

*  $\forall$: starts. $u_1, u_2, \overline{e}_1, \overline{e}_2 \models \neg F$.
*  $\exists$: strikes back. ${\color{blue}{u_1, u_2}}, e_1, \overline{e}_2 \models F$.
*  $\forall$: has to backtrack. It doesn't matter what $u_1$ is assigned to. It is already the case that $u_2, e_1, \overline{e}_2 \models F$.
*  $\forall$: learns $\neg u_2$. 
*  $\forall$: ${\color{red}{\overline{u}_2}}, u_1, \overline{e}_1, \overline{e}_2 \models \neg F$.
*  $\exists$: counters - ${\color{red}{\overline{u}_2}}, {\color{blue}{u_1}}, \overline{e}_1, e_2 \models F$.
*  $\forall$: has lost!. It is already the case that ${\color{red}{\overline{u}_2}}, \overline{e}_1, e_2 \models F$.

To summarize the approach:

* There are two players
  * $\forall$ - tries to satisfy $\neg F$
  * $\exists$ - tries to satisfy $F$

* Players control their variables. For example, take
  $\exists x_1 \forall x_2 \exists x_3 \forall x_4 \ldots F$ at round $2$: 
  * value of $x_1$ is already fixed,
  * $\forall$ fixes value of $x_2$, 
  * $\forall$ fixes value of $x_4$, but can change again at round $4$,
  * $\forall$ can guess values of $x_3$ to satisfy $\neg F$.

* Some player loses at round $i + 2$. At this stage;
  * Create succinct _no-good_ to strengthen $F$ resp. $\neg F$ depending on who lost.
  * Backjump to round $i$ (or below).

The main ingredients to the approach is thus _projection_ and _strategies_.

* Projections are added to _learn_ from mistakes.
  Thus, a player avoids repeating same losing moves.

* Strategies _prune_ moves from the opponent. 


We will here just illustrate an example of projection. Z3 uses _model based projection_
[@MouraJ13;@KomuravelliGC14]
to find a satisfiable quantifier-free formula that implies the existentially quantified
formula that encodes the losing state.

~ Example

Suppose we would want to compute a quantifier-free formula
that implies $\exists x \ . \ (2y \leq x \wedge y - z \leq x \wedge x \leq z)$.
Note that the formula is equivalent to a quantifier free formula:


$\exists x \ . \ (2y \leq x \wedge y - z \leq x \wedge x \leq z) \equiv
                  (y - z \leq 2y \leq z) \vee (2y \leq y - z \leq z)
$

but the size of the equivalent formula is quadratic in the size of the original formula.
Suppose we have a satisfying assignment for the formula inside of the existential 
quantifier. Say $M = [x \mapsto 3, y \mapsto 1, z \mapsto 6]$.
Then $2y^M = 2$ and  $(y-z)^M = -5$, and therefore
$2y > y - z$ under $M$. The greatest lower bound for $x$ is therefore $2y$
and we can select this branch as our choice for elimination of $x$.
The result of projection is then
$
   y - z \leq 2y \leq z.
$

~


## NLSat
The solver created when invoking `SolverFor('QF_NRA')`{language:python} relies on 
a self-contained engine that is specialized for solving non-linear arithmetic formulas
[@JovanovicM12]. It is a decision procedure for quantifier-free formulas over the reals
using polynomial arithmetic.

```python
s = SolverFor("QF_NRA")
x, y = Reals('x y')
s.add(x**3 + x*y + 1 == 0, x*y > 1, x**2 < 1.1)
print(s.check())
```

The NLSat solver is automatically configured if the formula is syntactically in the `QF_NRA`{language:smt} fragment.
So one can directly use it without specifying the specialized solver:
```python
set_option(precision=30)
print "Solving, and displaying result with 30 decimal places"
solve(x**2 + y**2 == 3, x**3 == 2)
```

# Tactics { #sec-tactics }
In contrast to solvers that ultimately check the satisfiability of a set of assertions, tactics
transform assertions to sets of assertions, in a way that a proof-tree is comprised of
nodes representing goals, and children representing subgoals. Many useful pre-processing
steps can be formulated as tactics. They take one goal and create a subgoal. 

## Tactic Basics

You can access the set of tactics 
```python
print(tactics())
```
and for additional information obtain a description of optional parameters:
```python
for name in tactics():
    t = Tactic(name)
    print(name, t.help(), t.param_descrs())
```

We will here give a single example of a tactic application. It transforms a goal to a simplified 
subgoal obtained by eliminating a quantifier that is trivially reducible and by combining repeated
formulas into one.
```python
x, y = Reals('x y')
g  = Goal()
g.add(2 < x, Exists(y, And(y > 0, x == y + 2)))
print(g)

t1 = Tactic('qe-light')
t2 = Tactic('simplify')
t  = Then(t1, t2)
print(t(g))
```


Additional information on tactics is available from [@MouraP13], 
<https://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/strategies> 
and 
<http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~msagiv/courses/asv/z3py/strategies-examples.htm>.

## Solvers from Tactics
Given a tactic `t`, the method `t.solver()` extracts a solver object that applies the tactic to the current assertions
and reports `sat` or `unsat` if it is able to reduce subgoals to a definite answer. 

## Tactics from Solvers
There is no method that corresponds to producing a tactic from a solver. Instead Z3 exposes a set of
built-in tactics for the main solvers. These are accessed through the names `sat`, `smt`, `qsat` (and `nlqsat` for quantified non-linear real arithmetic, 
e.g., the logic `NRA`{language:smt}), `qffd` for `QF_FD`{language:smt} and `nlsat` for `QF_NRA`{language:smt}. 

## Parallel Z3 { #sec-parallel-z3 }

By setting the parameter `set_param("parallel.enable", True)`{language:python} enables Z3's parallel mode. 
   Selected tactics, including `qfbv`, that uses the SAT solver for sub-goals the option, when enabled, 
   will cause Z3 to use a cube-and-conquer approach to solve subgoals. The tactics `psat`, `psmt` and `pqffd`
   provide direct access to the parallel mode, but you have to make sure that `"parallel.enable"` is true
   to force them to use parallel mode.
   You can control how the cube-and-conquer procedure
   spends time in simplification and cubing through other parameters under the `parallel` name-space.

The main option to toggle is `parallel.threads.max`. It caps the maximal number of threads. By default, the maximal number of threads used by the parallel solver
is bound by the number of processes.

# Optimization { #sec-optimization } 

Depending on applications, learning that a formula is satisfiable or not, may not be sufficient.
Sometimes, it is useful to retrieve models that are _optimal_ with respect to some objective function.
Z3 supports a small repertoire of objective functions and invokes a specialized optimization module
when objective functions are supplied. From the Python API, one uses the `Optimize`{language:python}
context to specify optimization problems. The `Optimize` context relies on the built-in solvers
for solving optimization queries. The architecture of the optimization context is provided in Figure [#fig-maxsmt].

The `Optimize`{language:python} context provides three main extensions to satisfiability checking:

```python
      o = Optimize()

      x, y = Ints('x y')
      o.maximize(x + 2*y)           # maximizes LIA objective

      u, v = BitVecs('u v', 32)
      o.minimize(u + v)             # minimizes BV objective

      o.add_soft(x > 4, 4)          # soft constraint with 
                                    # optional weight
```

Using soft assertions is equivalent to posing
an 0-1 optimization problem. Thus, the following
formulations are equivalent and Z3 detects the
second variant and turns it into a set of weighted
soft assertions.

```python
   a, b = Bools('a b')
   o.add_soft(a, 3)                                          
   o.add_soft(b, 4)
```
is equivalent to

```python
   o.minimize(If(a, 0, 3) + If(b, 0, 4))
```



## Multiple Objectives

It is possible to add multiple objectives. There are three ways to combine objective functions.

|                              |                                             |
|:-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Box$(x,y)$                   |   $v_x := \max \{ x \mid \varphi(x,y) \}$   |
|                              |   $v_y := \max \{ y \mid \varphi(x,y) \}$   |
+------------------------------|---------------------------------------------+
| Lex$(x,y)$                   |   $v_x := \max \{ x \mid \varphi(x,y) \}$   |
|                              |   $v_y := \max \{ y \mid \varphi(v_x,y) \}$ |
+------------------------------|---------------------------------------------+
| Pareto$(x,y)$                |   $\left\{ (v_x, v_y) \mid \begin{array}{l}\varphi(v_x,v_y),\ \forall x, y . \\ \varphi(x,y) \rightarrow x \leq v_x \vee y \leq v_y \end{array}\right\}$ |
+------------------------------|---------------------------------------------+

For instance, Pareto objectives can be specified as follows:

```python
x, y = Ints('x y')
opt = Optimize()
opt.set(priority='pareto')
opt.add(x + y == 10, x >= 0, y >= 0)
mx = opt.maximize(x)
my = opt.maximize(y)
while opt.check() == sat:
    print (mx.value(), my.value())

```


## MaxSAT

The conventional definition of MaxSAT is to minimize the number of violated _soft_ assertions.
There are several algorithms for MaxSAT, and developing new algorithms is a very active area
of research. We will here describe MaxRes from [@NarodytskaB14]. It is also Z3's default
solver for MaxSAT/MaxSMT problems. 
As an illustration assume we are given an _unweighted_ (all soft constraints have weight 1) 
MaxSAT problem $F, F_1, \ldots, F_5$,
where the first four soft constraints cannot be satisfied in conjunction
with the hard constraint $F$. 
Thus, we have the case: 

~ Math
 A: F, \underbrace{F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4 }_{core}, F_5
~ 

The system is transformed to a weakened MaxSAT problem as follows:

~ Math
A': F, \ F_2 \vee F_1, F_3 \vee (F_2 \wedge F_1), 
   F_4 \vee (F_3 \wedge (F_2 \wedge F_1)), F_5
~

The procedure is formalized in Figure [#fig-maxres].
We claim that by solving $A'$, we can find an optimal solution to $A$.
For this purpose, consider the _cost_ of a model with respect to a MaxSAT
problem. The cost, written $cost(M, A)$ is the number of soft constraints
in $A$ that are _false_ under $M$. More precisely,

~ Lemma { #lemma-dec }
For every model $M$ of $F$, $cost(M, A) = 1 + cost(M, A')$
~

~ Proof { #pr-dec; caption: "of lemma [#lemma-dec]" }
To be able to refer to the soft constraints in the transformed systems $A'$
we will give names to the new soft constraints, such that
$F_1'$ is a name for $F_2 \vee F_1$, $F_2'$ names 
$F_3 \vee (F_2 \wedge F_1)$, $F_3'$ is the name for 
$F_4 \vee (F_3 \wedge (F_2 \wedge F_1))$ and $F_4'$ is the new name of $F_5$.

Consider the soft constraints in the core. 
Since it is a core, at least one has to be false under $M$.
Let $j$ be the first index among where $M(F_j)$ is false.
Then $M$ evaluates all other soft constraints the same, 
e.g., $\forall i < j: \ M(F'_i) = M(F_{i})$, 
and $\forall i > j: M(F'_{i-1}) = M(F_i)$.
$\Box$
~

Thus, eventually, it is possible to satisfy all soft constraints 
(weakening could potentially create 0 soft constraints), and a solution
to the weakened system is an optimal solution.

~ Figure { #fig-maxres; caption:"Core based MaxSAT using [MaxRes](https://github.com/Z3Prover/doc/blob/master/programmingz3/code/maxres.py)" }
```python
def add_def(s, fml):
    name = Bool("%s" % fml)
    s.add(name == fml)
    return name

def relax_core(s, core, Fs):
    prefix = BoolVal(True)
    Fs -= { f for f in core }
    for i in range(len(core)-1):
        prefix = add_def(s, And(core[i], prefix))
        Fs |= { add_def(s, Or(prefix, core[i+1])) }

def maxsat(s, Fs):
    cost = 0
    Fs0 = Fs.copy()
    while unsat == s.check(Fs):
        cost += 1
        relax_core(s, s.unsat_core(), Fs)    
    return cost, { f for f in Fs0 if tt(s, f) }
```
~

Weighted assertions can be handled by a reduction to unweighted MaxSAT. For example, 

```python
a, b, c = Bools('a b c')
o = Optimize()
o.add(a == c)
o.add(Not(And(a, b)))

Efficient implementations of MaxSAT flatten weights on demand. 
Given a core of soft constraints it is split into two parts: 
In one part all soft constraints have the same coefficient as the
weight of the soft constraint with the minimal weight. 
The other part comprises of the remaining soft constraints.
For our example, `a, b` is a core and the weight of `a` is 2, while
the weight of `b` is 3. The weight of `b` can therefore be split
into two parts, one where it has weight 2, and the other where it has weight 1.
Applying the transformation for the the core we obtain the simpler MaxSAT problem:

```python
a, b, c = Bools('a b c')
o = Optimize()
o.add(a == c)
o.add(Not(And(a, b)))
o.add_soft(Or(a, b), 2)
o.add_soft(b, 1)
o.add_soft(c, 1)
print(o.check())
print(o.model())
```

# Summary

This tutorial presented an overview of main functionality exposed by Z3. By presenting some of the underlying algorithms in
an example driven way we have attempted to give a taste of the underlying decision procedures and proof engines. By
presenting examples of programming queries on top of Z3 we have attempted to provide an introduction to turning SMT solving
into a service for logic queries that go beyond checking for satisfiability of a single formula. Tuning extended queries
on top of the basic services provided by SAT and SMT solvers is a very active area of research with new application scenarios and 
new discoveries.
